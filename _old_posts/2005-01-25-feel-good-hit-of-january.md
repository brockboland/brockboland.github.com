I've been meaning to start writing here for a couple weeks now, but I keep putting it off, saying that I'd like to design the site and get it running the way I want to first.  Anyone who knows me can attest to the fact that it will be at least another month before I have a chance to do that, so I don't know how I convinced myself that I was going to do it any time soon.

Chances are good that you know me, at least through LiveJournal, if you're reading this within weeks of my writing it.  I intend to continue writing in <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/brocklisoup/">my LJ</a> about more personal things - the boring day-to-day crap.  It will continue to be a journal.

This will be a blog.  Here, I will be writing about projects I'm working on, academics, and the occasional interesting story or social commentary.  I'd like this to be more than a boring, overly-technical blog that will only be interesting to the handful of people that are interested in the same things I am.  I'd like to think that this will become something everyone can enjoy reading, but we'll start small.

As I've said there many times, I write in my LiveJournal for myself - it's a journal, and that's what I use it for.  Here, I'd like to write for other people just as much as myself.

I'll be working out the kinks in the next week or two, changing MT's templates considerably, and hopefully giving you something interesting to read.  I hope you'll stop by once in a while and see what I'm up to.
