Before I tell this story, let me be clear: I am not a pothead. I've smoked pot about a dozen times over the course of a couple years, and not in the past several months.

The first quarter of my freshman year here, I used to stand outside and smoke with my buddy M all the time. He introduced me to Camel Wide Gauges, which are still my favorite kind of cigarettes. At some point I mentioned that I wanted to try pot while I had the chance to be irresponsible in college, and he immediately offered to provide. I had heard that you won't get high the first time you smoked, so we agreed that we should just smoke a lot of it.

That weekend, the two of us went out to B lot and moved his little 1986 VW Jetta to the back row, and smoked three bowls in a matter of 15 minutes. The tiny car was hazy with smoke. M was obviously affected by it, because when it came time to tap out the bowl, he did it into his hand. The ash - and with it, the cherry - landed in his palm and burned his hand. His door was closed, so he didn't know what to do with it and started tossing it back and forth, hot potato style. I laughed so hard I nearly pissed myself; I actually had to get out and pee in the woods because I was honestly afraid I was going to piss.

We walked back to the dorms and stopped into the Corner Store. I was still convinced that I was sober, because no one gets stoned the first time they smoke, right? I bought a liter of Mountain Dew and a box of Little Debbie Star Cakes, M got a drink and a box of some kind of Little Debbies, and went up to hang out in his room. For the next two hours, I laughed more than I had in weeks, drained the soda, and finished off the box of Star Cakes. They tasted so good I couldn't stop eating them. I was convinced I didn't get stoned, but I have never known munchies like that.

M left RIT after winter quarter, and I haven't seen him since. I've smoked with a handful of different people since then, but I don't think I've ever had as much fun with it as I did that night.  He gave me a chance to try something new, and that's what I came to college for.
