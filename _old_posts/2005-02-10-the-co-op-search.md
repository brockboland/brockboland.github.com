In the past couple weeks, I've sent resumes to a number of on-campus departments for various co-ops.  Without a car, my options are limited to campus and close to my parents' house in Buffalo.  I certainly don't want to leave behind all my friends here for another 3 months, so I'm focusing my efforts on jobs here.

I only heard back on two of the resumes I sent in, and both interviews were on Tuesday.  The first was for a Systems Administrator Assistant in the College of Business (the job Joanna currently holds, and Nik had before her).  I checked my e-mail shortly before the interview to make sure I had the right room, and noticed a line I had missed before - "Please bring a list of references."

I quickly whipped up a list and frantically tried to print it.  I couldn't get my printer to work, so I stopped into the lab in CoB, but only business students are allowed to print there.  I pulled out my laptop (thanks again, Apple) and e-mailed it to the guy I was interviewing with, hoping that would be OK.

As it turns out, that <i>was</i> OK, but I was so flustered that I didn't do very well in the interview.  On top of that, I had been sick for a few days already and always feel out of it.  I had to keep reminding myself to pay attention to what we were talking about and make sure my eyes were in focus.  The interview only lasted 10 or 15 minutes, so I don't think I really had time to convince them I'd be good at it.  Both of the guys I met with were really friendly though, and I think they'd be cool to work with if I did get the job.  I think they said they had interviews through part of next week, so it might be a while before I find out.

Half an hour later, I had the interview for the Evening Operations Assistant at DSS.  I got there 5 or 10 minutes early and sat down to wait.  Shortly after my 3:30 appointment time, the girl working there mentioned that the previous interview had started 10 minutes early and was running late - not a good sign for me.  As it turns out, the guy before me was Vicki's little brother Bill.  I haven't seen him since we spent the weekend in Corning two and a half years ago, and I wouldn't have recognized him if he hadn't added me on <a href="http://www.thefacebook.com/">thefacebook</a> a couple weeks ago.

Anyway, the interview lasted about 45 minutes, and was with two women that manage the labs and two guys who have done the job before.  This one went better, because I had more time to get over the initial nervousness and be myself.  I should have prepared better for the interview, though; I should have considered answers for standard questions like describing a conflict I've had with a customer before and how I dealt with it.  I had thought of things to say when they asked me to tell them about myself, but I hadn’t really thought about customer service type questions.  They had interviews scheduled until today or tomorrow, and the position starts right after finals, so I should know soon one way or the other.

The other problem I have in interviews is that I’m not sure how to act.  My interview at Tech Crew three years ago was very laid back; it was four or five of the student supervisors and me, just kind of hanging out so they could get to know me and find out what I’m capable of.  In an environment like CoB or DSS, it’s obviously more professional, so I act accordingly.  At the same, I don’t want to seem too stuffy and boring if it turns out their office is as relaxed as Tech Crew or the library.  I’m certainly not trying to act like someone else in the interview, but you need have an appropriate manner for the situation, and I’m never quite sure what that is.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do if I don't get one of these two.  I don't have any financial aid left for the year, so I can't take classes unless I take a huge student loan to cover them.  I was considering that as Plan B.  If I did, I would do a co-op sometime next year instead of classes and therefore need a smaller loan for the year, and it should all even out.  However, since I'll only be taking 2 quarters of classes in the 2005-06 school year, I'll be pretty well off if my financial aid stays the same as it usually does.

But I suppose I'll worry about that if I don't get a co-op.
