...someone in your Genetic Algorithms class evolves the best dance pattern for Dance Dance Revolution.  And when he shows a demo, someone else in the class asks what song it was.  And instead of naming a common DDR song so all the geeks can nod in approval, he names a Final Fantasy song that he made up his own dance for, eliciting even more approving nods.

I may be proud to be a geek, but some of these guys are ridiculous.
