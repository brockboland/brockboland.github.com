I just talked to Dave over at the College of Business, and I got the job!  You're looking (kinda) at the new Systems Administrator Assistant!

Man, saying that out loud makes me feel terribly under-qualified.

I'm so glad I can stop worrying about this.  No more worries about loans, or what classes I'll take (assuming they even let me register), and I can start paying back some debts.  This is a huge weight off my shoulders.

Plus, I can finally get some shit done.  I never have time for my own projects when I've got a ton of crap to do for classes.  On co-op, the day ends at 5 (or in this case, 10, I think).  I can come home and read, or watch movies, or finish countless projects that have been <acronym title="CSH Done, adj.  Approximately 90% completed">CSH Done</acronym> for years.  On top of that, I'm going to learn a lot on the job.

It's going to be a good quarter.
