Today was my last day of class for the next (hopefully) six months.  It's nice to know I won't have to get up early for them or do homework next week, but I'm not out of the woods yet.  I've still got final projects due in Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Algorithms, along with three finals and a presentation.  It will all be over by Wednesday evening.

I know I say it every quarter, but I can't believe it's almost over.  Not that I'm complaining - this has been, without a doubt, the worst quarter I've ever had.  AI and GA turned out to be entirely unlike what I expected them to be.  It's not even like I was doing poorly in either of them; they were both so disappointing that I gave up on them halfway through the quarter.  As a result of my disgust, this whole quarter has left me with a bad taste in my mouth, despite the fact that Film Arts and Discrete both went really well.  I fear that AI may be my first D ever - I did pretty bad on the quizzes we took, I'm way behind on the project that's due Sunday night, and I can't imagine I'm going to ace the final next week.  Every time I start worrying about it, I have a quick, 15-second anxiety attack about all the work I have left and how poorly I'm probably going to do.  Then I think, "Man, I usually only get this stressed over money!"  And then I start thinking about how financially screwed I am, and REALLY start to panic.

And then I remember that everything has always worked out OK in the past, and I get back to reading blogs in NetNewsWire, or writing here, or watching The Simpsons (my soup du jour this month).

I'm not going to do great this quarter, but I'm OK with it.  Neither AI nor GA is going to factor into my GPA, with the switch to IT, so it's hard to get too worked up about it.  I'd rather keep from stressing myself into an ulcer and just make it to Wednesday alive.
