Fonny had a link to <a href="/images/EmoFarm(med).mov">this video</a> (37.3MB) in his away message this afternoon.  I was really impressed with how well-made it was (particularly the guys' accents - it drives me nuts when redneck accents go over the top), and it's absolutely hilarious.  It's worth the wait to download it.
