The other day, I ordered three 6' x 18" rolls of <a href="http://store.teachchildren.com/dna9042.html">Memoboard</a> dry-erase contact paper.  They came this morning, so I stopped by the bookstore and got a roll of 1" black photo masking tape to make a frame.  It was a total pain the ass, but I managed to get it up in the living room.  I was going to use all three rolls in there, but decided that a 4.5' white board would be a little much.  It looks pretty good, but there were bumps on the wall that made it a bit lumpy in spots.  I'm going to cut the last roll in half and put a 3' x 3.5' board on the other wall in my room.  Click on the picture for the full-size version (not that there's much more to see).

Also, you know it's been a busy week when NetNewsWire reports I have 590 unread items.  Seems I have a lot of reading to catch up on.  I also grabbed a couple Hunter S. Thompson books at the library when I heard about his death; I figured it was about time I find out what all the fuss is about.  I've started (but haven't gotten very far in) <i>Fear and Loathing in America, vol. 2</i> and also got <i>Kingdom of Fear</i>.  <i>Fear and Loathing</i> is a collection of his letters over the years, and a couple of his articles were mentioned.  I had some time to kill the other day when I was working in VIA, so I found them on microfilm and printed them out.  I scanned them and made PDFs out of them too, but I'm not really sure why.  If nothing else, I'll always have a copy of them somewhere.
