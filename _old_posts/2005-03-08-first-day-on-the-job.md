I started at the College of Business today, and it went better than I thought it would.  Everyone there is great - literally, <i>everyone</i> I met was friendly.  My boss took me on a quick tour of the department, so I met a couple dozen people, and they were some of the nicest folks I've met at RIT.

That may all change when they're coming to me with problems, but for now, it's nice.

Unfortunately, I had a blinding headache by the end of the day.  I noticed that my screen seemed kind of flickery early on, but I chalked it up to the KVM.  Toward the end of the day, I figured I may as well check the monitor settings just in case, and sure enough, the refresh rate was set at 60 Hz.  I'm hoping that it won't cause me any more grief now that I've turned it up.

I have high hopes for this quarter.  The co-op is looking promising.  I can sleep in till 10:30 every day but Friday.  I've already heard about a few good parties coming in the next couple weeks.  I have time to read and a stack of books and magazines I haven't gotten to.  Today saw a high of 54F (well, and some rain).  It's going to be a good spring.
