In the past couple weeks I've seen <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/03/earworm">several</a> <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/03/this_weeks_best.html">people</a> talking about that new Kelly Clarkson song (there have been others, but those are the only two I can remember off the top of my head).  I just read Matthew Haughey's (of MetaFilter) <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/03/this_weeks_best.html">post</a> last night and downloaded the Ted Leo version.  I figured it wasn't too bad, so I went and found the original, and it's not bad.

BUT IT GETS IN YOUR HEAD AND WON'T GO AWAY.

It was there when I got up, just sort of at the back of my mind, not really irritating like some Counting Crows songs have been lately.  As I'm hopping in the shower, I thought of kottke's <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/03/earworm">post</a> and now it won't go away.

Damn Internets.
