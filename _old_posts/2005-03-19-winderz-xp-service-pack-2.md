I hadn't re-installed Windows on my desktop since I got it last September, putting me just shy of the typical 18-month Windows life expectancy.  It had been acting up lately, and I found out the other day that Automatic Updates is going to force Service Pack 2 down sometime in April, so I figured I'd be safer installing it with a clean slate.  As I mentioned <a href="/2005/03/trivia">the other night</a>, I made an SP 2 boot CD for exactly this reason.  If you'd like to do the same, instructions are available at <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=47212312&pgno=1">Information Week</a>, or I can send you the ISO, as long as you promise you've got a license for XP Pro.

Rebuilding a Windows machine is always a pain, but this was probably the easiest I've ever had it.  I'm really glad I planned ahead and partitioned my drive when I got the machine last September - C: for program files, D: for data.  I just had to back up a few things on the D: drive - my Firefox bookmarks were about the most important thing - and have at it.  The toughest part is getting everything setup the way you like it, because stupid little things crop up for weeks until you manage to get it all configured just right.  Everything feels so clean and sterile, it's like I'm using someone else's computer.

The part that really pisses me off is that I can't find an old version of AIM, so I can't use DeadAIM.  I'm using Gaim at the moment, but I've never liked it.  I had a lot of problems with it the last time I tried it.  If I remember right, the windows were blank when I came back to the machine after using Remote Desktop Connection while I was gone.  I imagine it's a problem between RDC and GTK; maybe I'll even look for a fix one of these days.  If I'm not mistaken, <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a> is built on Gaim; someone should do a Windows port, methinks.

Aside from AIM, the rest of my day-to-day stuff is set up.  I've saved passwords on the sites I frequent and started recreating the shortcuts I had.  I'm really glad I didn't have to go through a time-consuming backup sequence this time around, but it's still a pain in the neck.
