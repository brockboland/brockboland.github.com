Looking at pictures is like eating chocolate cake.  You see, chocolate cake is great every now and then, but if you have it every day, you won't appreciate it any more.

When I went home this past weekend, I grabbed a copy of those <a href="/2005/03/remember-when">photos I scanned over Christmas break</a>.  Looking through them again was a lot of fun.  I had seen a few before, when I was younger, but most of them were all new to me when I scanned them a few months ago.  Going through them again today and deciding which ones to post made me all nostalgic.  Photos that we see every day quickly lose their meaning.  My mom has some pictures of my brothers and I around the house, and I barely even notice them any more.  But looking through pictures every once in a great while makes it that much more special.

At any rate, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/187216/">they're up on Flickr</a>.  Enjoy.
