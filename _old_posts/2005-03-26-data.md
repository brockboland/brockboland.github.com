I think we can all agree that the Internet is pretty totally awesome.  I don't know how people found information before the web became popular and sites like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a> came into being.  If I couldn't use the web to find what I'm looking for, I'm not even sure I could figure out how to work a library to get what I want.

Depending on what information I need, I consult different web sites.  These are the ones I use most often.  I figured I'd mention them here in hopes that someone else can find a helpful resource.  If you can think of others, please let me know, because I'm always looking to improve my knowledge base.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/">The Internet Movie Database</a>
Everything you need to know about movies, and I mean EVERYTHING.  If you you want to know what actors Bruce Willis has worked with, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/WorkedWith?name=Willis%2C+Bruce+%28I%29&as=a&with=a">you can find out</a>.  We use IMDB to settle challenges in The Movie Game.  Casey once called me from Potter's place in the Adirondacks to check IMDB and settle a bet she had with James.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>
The collective encyclopedia of everything.  Users contribute to the text, so you can find just about anything you want, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elma,_New_York">my home town</a>.

<a href="http://www.allmusic.com/">allmusic</a>
What the Ultimate Band List used to be, but better.  You can find every album a song was on, all songs done by an artist, the original performer of a given song, etc.

<a href="http://www.answers.com/">Answers.com</a>
This site is like an encyclopedia on speed.  For example: do a search for <a href="http://www.answers.com/harley%20davidson">"harley davidson"</a> and you can get info on <a href="http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery;jsessionid=3j6kop662n3dr?tname=harley-davidson&sbid=lc03a&method=6">Harley-Davidson corporation</a> or <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/hells-angels">Hells Angels</a>.  Similar to Wikipedia, but pulls from more sources.

<a href="http://www.tvtome.com/">TV Tome</a>
Info on TV shows.  I mostly use this one to find out what the current episode number is for Scrubs, so I can find the video online.

<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>
The source of all knowledge, and usually my starting point when I want to know anything.  You can look up words (define:), find phone numbers (just enter a name and city), do reverse phone lookup (enter the number), track UPS or FedEx packages, check out a UPC code, or find information on a flight number.  You can find a <a href="http://local.google.com/local?num=30&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=pizza&near=rochester+ny&btnG=Search&sc=1&rl=1">nearby pizzeria</a>, and with the new <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>, find out exactly how to get there.  If you're not using Google already, I don't know how you're getting anything done.

The Internet is an incredible wealth of knowledge and an amazing time saver.  I can generally find information I'm looking for within a few minutes.  I can't even imagine how I would learn without it.
