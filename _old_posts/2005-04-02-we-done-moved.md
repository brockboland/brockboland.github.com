With the recent acquisition of <a href="http://www.brockli.com">BrockLi.com</a>, this site is now being hosted on <a href="http://www.1and1.com">1&1</a>.  The new links to all old entries are on the <a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~brock/index.html">old home page</a> - everything has been moved over successfully.  Please update your bookmarks as necessary.

If you're using a news reader, you can subscribe to the <a href="/atom.xml">new Atom feed</a> or the <a href="/index.xml">RSS 2.0 feed</a>.  I've redirected them both though, so the old ones should continue to work (you folks subscribing to brock_blog in LiveJournal should continue seeing my posts).

Thanks for reading, and please drop me a note if you find something that's broken.
