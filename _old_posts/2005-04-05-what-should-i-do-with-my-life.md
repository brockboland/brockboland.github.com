I started this book two weeks ago at <a href="http://www.ryandoherty.net/">Ryan's</a> suggestion.  He mentioned it several times in conversation and kept telling me I would love it, so I couldn't pass it up when I found it on the Media Play bargain racks for less than $8.  It's a collection of stories about people who have been asking themselves (appropriately) what they should do with their lives.  Some of them are success stories, while others are still looking for their path in life.  It came to me at a good time; with graduation looming, I've been trying to figure out what the hell I should be doing in a year.  I'll post a review when I finish it.
