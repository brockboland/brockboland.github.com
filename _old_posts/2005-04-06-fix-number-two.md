CatEntries didn't work out <a href="/2005/04/mt-dbms">as well as I'd hoped</a>.  For some reason, the home page wouldn't rebuild when a new entry was posted.  So I changed it back to MTEntries, and the recent movies and books will appear on the home page and in the feeds.  I didn't realize MTEntries has a `category` option that can be used to select what categories to show, though it doesn't allow exclusions.  I'm using that now in the sidebar, but those categories will still appear in the main page and such.  I'm OK with it - I'll just start writing reviews.
