I can't tell you how happy I am that I found <a href="http://brevity.org/code/mozilla/greasemonkey/lickr/">Lickr</a> on the <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/">del.icio.us popular page</a>.  It's a GreaseMonkey script that replaces Flickr's flash image with a regular JPEG image and text links for the tool bar.  Apparently there's a bug in Firefox on Mac OS X that causes Flash movies to "disappear" if you scroll the wrong way.  My options seemed to be converting to Safari, or removing Flash so I could at least view the images sans tool bar.  With Lickr, I get all the options and a shorter load time.

Sometimes the Internet gives me things that make me happy.  Like this.  And porn.
