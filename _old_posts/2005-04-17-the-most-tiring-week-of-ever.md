This week has been straight up exhausting.  Wednesday night was the <a href="http://www.floggingmolly.com/">Flogging Molly</a> show at Water Street, which warrants its own post if I can find the motivation to sit down and write about it (and if I don't, it was totally awesome).  Tuesday and Thursday were bowling nights.  Friday I spent the evening hanging out on floor.  And yesterday, we had a barbecue.

Shane and Schmitty decided they needed to change their oil, and figured a BBQ was in order.  Without anywhere to host it, they asked if they could do it at the grill next to my building.  Obviously, I agreed that this was a brilliant idea.  Shane dubbed it the Oil Change Cookout Extravaganza.

As it turns out, Shane was the only one that needed an oil change, but we had a hell of a BBQ.  There were probably close to 25 people here throughout the course of the afternoon.  We killed off about 25 burgers, 16 hot dogs, 8 steaks, a six-pack of fancy beer (James') and a 30-rack of Miller High Life.  A little before 8, the seven of us that were still hanging out went to Abbott's for frozen custard, then came back to my place and watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118863/">Clay Pigeons</a>.  Klem and BP were the last to leave, around 1, making it an eleven-hour BBQ.

I absolutely love being on co-op in Rochester.  I can waste an entire day just hanging out and cooking meat, and I don't feel guilty in the least because I don't have any projects hanging over my head.  There are still several projects I want to do for myself, but enjoying the company of friends is far more important than making a web-based Ajax-powered newsletter editor for CSH.  That can wait.

Today, I'm hanging out on floor.  I may do some reading, or some coding, or maybe not.  It's beautiful outside, I don't have any responsibilities, and I can slack off all day if I want to.

I love spring.
