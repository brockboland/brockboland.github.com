Can I get a moment of silence for my Control Panel?





Thank you.

I decided to launch another offensive on my <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/brocklisoup/488409.html">Powershot problem</a>.  Apparently I've still got Canon drivers installed somewhere, so I wanted to try again to completely remove them.  When I plugged in the camera and tried to open the Control Panel so I could get to Scanners and Cameras to remove it, explorer.exe crashed on me.  After a reboot (and repeating this process 2 or 3 times), I decided all is lost.  I have no idea what's wrong with it - there was an error message the first time it happened (some missing DLL, maybe), but who the hell reads those?  Looks like I'll be re-installing XP <a href="/2005/03/winderz-xp-service-pack-2">AGAIN</a>.

Either way, I found that <a href="http://www.picasa.com/">Picasa</a> does a pretty good job of importing photos from a camera, so I'm just going to use that from now on.  I've been mounting a share on my desktop from my iBook and copying photos through the Mac, but it's just a pain in the ass.  I import everything into Picasa anyway, so it makes more sense to just start there.

Now, I just wish Google had bought <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli">Flickr</a> so I could upload photos from Picasa.  Stupid Yahoo.

Also, my <a href="/2005/04/i-love-flickr-more-muffins">two free Pro accounts</a> have been claimed by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jymferrier/">Jym Bob</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/66254725@N00/">Sarah</a>, respectively.
