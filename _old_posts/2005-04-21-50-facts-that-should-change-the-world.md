I learned a lot from this book, but not as much new stuff as I expected.  A lot of the facts just confirmed (with extensive footnotes) that everything is all messed up.  It was pretty easy to read, because each one was only three or four pages, but not a good bed time book because you start to thinking about how really absurd some things are, and then you can't sleep.  I have a feeling that this one will be backing me up in a lot of political arguments.
