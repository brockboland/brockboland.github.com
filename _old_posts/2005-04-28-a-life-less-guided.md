I learned last night, in a dream, that I can ride a wheelie on a motorcycle, even if the back tire is flat because the sidewalls are split.

I also learned, in real life, that a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/10793533/in/set-266284/">ginormous bottle of JD</a> won't last nearly as long as you might think.  It's not gone, but pretty damn close.  BP, James, and I grilled steaks last night, and found that whiskey makes a decent A1 Sauce alternative.

They say the two things you shouldn't debate are politics and religion, so that's exactly what we did.  A few drinks will always make arguments more interesting, and by the end of the night we were all happy that BP and James hadn't started throwing punches.  JymBob got hats right before the last election - "Proud (Donkey)" and "Proud (Elephant)."  He put them on James and BP, respectively, just so we were all clear on who was saying what.

I won't be going home this weekend after all, because it turns out that it's already time for Spring Fest.  We're talking about doing another big BBQ on Saturday, but it looks like the forces of weather are conspiring against us, so that probably won't happen.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a> comes out tomorrow, so I'm going to see it with Heewa.  I wanted to read the series again before seeing it, but it's a little late for that now.  I'm a little concerned that the trailers I've seen all tout it as some great space action flick.  The fact of the matter is, the books weren't great because of a thrilling sci-fi storyline; it was Adams' humor and incredible writing style that made them good.  I really don't think it's going to translate well to film, but I'll give it a chance.
