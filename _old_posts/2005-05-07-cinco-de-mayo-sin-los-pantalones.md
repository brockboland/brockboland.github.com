I'm a couple days behind with this, but Thursday was Cinco de Mayo and Friday was No Pants Day.  We had a small-ish shindig here for Cinco de Mayo, with made a nice segue into <a href="http://www.nopantsday.com/">No Pants Day</a> at midnight since we were mostly drunk by then.  We messaged pretty much everyone around midnight and told them to meet at the Sentinel for a big no pants group picture, and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/tags/fizzleoh/">Fizzle-Oh</a> crew joined us.  Then we rode the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/tags/tiger/">Tiger</a>.  Then we went into <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/tags/javawallys/">Java Wally's</a>, where we ran into RJ.  It was a fun night.  There are more pictures <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/309358/">on Flickr</a>.

Today was the CSH graduation party - it's fun to reminisce.  Toga is tonight, but I'm beat, so I'm not going.  Plus, I'm going home first thing in the morning to surprise my mom for Mother's Day.  I told my dad I wasn't coming home and he's pretty pissed - I'm afraid he might be MORE pissed when I show up after telling him I wouldn't than he would be if I just wasn't home for it, but I'll risk it.

I love books, and I'm finally making a conscious effort to make more time for reading.  Today, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743232933/qid=1115507137/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-9902182-2998200?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Ruminations on College Life</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590593219/qid=1115507155/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-9902182-2998200?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Never Threaten to Eat Your Co-Workers: Best of Blogs</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1932133607/qid=1115507142/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-9902182-2998200?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Student Body Shots: A Sarcastic Look at the Best 4-6 Years of Your Life</a> came in today.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743269632/qid=1115507161/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-9902182-2998200?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Ruminations on Twentysomething Life</a> should be here in a couple days (it was shipped separately).  They're all light reads and pretty thin - I've got plenty of heavy-duty books I haven't gotten to yet, so I figured these would make nice in-betweeners.
