Friday was the last day of class this year.  Being on co-op, I haven't been paying much attention to the progression of the quarter, so the end of it snuck up on me.  Without finals and project due dates looming, I didn't realize how close to done we were, especially since I know I won't be leaving or changing my routine for the summer.  I saw a few people moving out of the dorms earlier today.  That's always depressing, even when it's people I don't know, because that means the people I DO know will be leaving soon too.

We were just talking about Welcome Back, and it seems like it was just last month.  I can't believe how quick this year went, but I guess we say that every year.  I've been living in the apartment just shy of a year now, making Brie the longest-running roommate I've ever had (excluding my younger brother, of course).

The end of the year is always tough.  Saying goodbye is always tough.  It's especially hard for me this quarter because I know this may well be my last spring at RIT.  It's starting to sink in that I've only got another six months till I'm done.  I may stay in the area once I finish, but I'm trying to make the most of the time I've got now just in case.

It's going to be a great summer, and a lot of cool people will be here, but it's still hard to send friends off for a three month break.
