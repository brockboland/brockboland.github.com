I just looked at my cell phone and thought, "May 24th.  Why does that sound familiar?"

I have a bad feeling that twenty minutes from now, I'll scream <i>FUCK!</i> when I realize today is a close friend's birthday, wedding, funeral, canonization, or some other life-changing event.

If you've been made a saint today, I meant to be there.
