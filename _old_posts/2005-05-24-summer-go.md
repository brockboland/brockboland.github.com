For the most part, everyone is settled.  Half of Jym's stuff still litters the living room, but <a href="http://www.blogbp.com/">BP</a> finished moving his stuff in.  Aside from <a href="http://www.jymferrier.net/">Jym</a>'s crap, the place is cleaner than it's ever been - I still can't believe how much trash we carried out of here.  Heewa is spending the night on the couch, since he has to be out of his place but didn't finish packing in time to head back to Connecticut.  BP bought a couple steaks for tomorrow evening's dinner.  Friday, we're heading to Toronto for the Against Me/Murder by Death show and a weekend of Canadian misadventures.

I've had a really hard time accepting the fact that summer is here.  I feel like I'm quickly running out of time with the people I've come to love, but this summer is off to a great start already.  All I can do is enjoy it while I can.
