I've started browsing <a href="http://blogdex.net/">Blogdex</a> on a less-than-regular basis to see what other people are talking about (where "less-than-regular" means "when I'm bored at work").  One of the top links today was <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=7591">Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries</a>.

Go give it a read.

I dare you.

It's scary to find out that there are actually people that believe this crap.  I mean, <i>Mein Kampf</i> I can get behind, sure.  <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, maybe, but more for the twisted results of Marxism than for the original communist ideals.  One of my favorite comments is about <i>Das Kapital</i>:

<blockquote>
Das Kapital forces the round peg of capitalism into the square hole of Marxâ€™s materialistic theory of history, portraying capitalism as an ugly phase in the development of human society in which capitalists inevitably and amorally exploit labor by paying the cheapest possible wages to earn the greatest possible profits. Marx theorized that the inevitable eventual outcome would be global proletarian revolution. He could not have predicted 21st Century America: a free, affluent society based on capitalism and representative government that people the world over envy and seek to emulate.
</blockquote>

Let me tell you WON'T see in America: laborers being exploited and paid the lowest possible wages to earn the greatest profites.  No siree Bob.  Just ask anyone in middle America.

Like I say: I love America, but I hate a lot of people in it.

On the upside, you can get a <a href="http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/nothing/doughnut.asp">free donut</a> today!
