I'm in Buffalo for the weekend to visit the family and get some time on the bike so I'm ready for the <a href="/2005/05/road-test">road test</a>.  This weekend, I've noticed the difference between RIT and the area I live in just by watching traffic.  You notice a marked decrease in BMW's and a lot more pickup trucks.  The weather's been nice, so there have been a lot of bikers out - of the 40 or 50 bikes I've seen in the past two days, only four of them were crotch rockets.

During one of these trips home, I want to scan more family photos.  I posted a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/187216/">bunch of them</a> a little while ago, but there are a lot more.  I grabbed six or seven rolls worth when I was home a few months ago.  They're the ones I took in middle and high school, but I keep forgetting to look through them and stop into the library to scan the good ones.  Maybe I'll do that this week.  I scanned about 20 more from two rolls my Mom took recently, so I'll post those when I'm back at RIT.

I haven't been to <a href="http://www.little-theatre.com/">The Little</a> since December, so I'm hoping to go tomorrow and catch a movie or two.  My membership ends this month, so I've only got a few more Sundays to go for free.
