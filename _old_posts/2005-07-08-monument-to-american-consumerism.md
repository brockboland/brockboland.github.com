I'm sitting in the Walden-Galleria mall by the Apple store (woo! free wireless!)

As of 9:30(ish) this morning, I am licensed by New York State to ride a motorcycle.  I think my dad won $10 from mom on that one.  I spent a couple hours riding around before heading out.

I'm off to Rochester in a minute here.  I bought some riding gloves and glasses at <a href="http://www.cyclestop.com/">Cycle Stop</a> before heading home, but the glasses let too much wind in and the gloves keep sliding up on my hands, so I'm going to stop in and see if I can't exchange them both.  Then it's off to the Adirondacks for a relaxing weekend.

See ya in a couple days!
