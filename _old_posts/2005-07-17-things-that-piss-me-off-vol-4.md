<b>iEverything</b>

Why the hell do companies think that adding a lower-case 'i' at the beginning of every product they offer will make it better?  I can't blame Apple, because that's kind of their "thing": iBook, iPod, iTunes, iMac, etc.  But <a href="http://www.iguitar.com/iGuitar/iGuitar.asp">iGuitar</a>?  Or <a href="http://www.iriveramerica.com/">iRiver</a>?  That one doesn't even make sense.  It's so ridiculous that companies are trying to make themselves seem innovative by cashing in on Apple's success.
