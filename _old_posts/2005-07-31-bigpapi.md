I don't remember where I found the link to <a href="http://www.staggernation.com/mtplugins/BigPAPI/">BigPAPI</a>, but it didn't seem worth trying until I got halfway down the page.  <a href="http://www.staggernation.com/mtplugins/UpdateAuthoredOn/">UpdateAuthoredOn</a> is a BigPAPI plugin (which is itself an MT plugin) that adds a button to a Movable Type entry page to update the Authored On value to the current time.  Since I frequently start a post and come back to it two or three times before publishing it, I'm always fiddling with the date and trying to figure out what 11:32 PM is in 24-hour time.  Now, I just click the button and it's done for me.

It doesn't seem like something to get worked up about, but it's the little things like this that make an interface pleasant to use.
