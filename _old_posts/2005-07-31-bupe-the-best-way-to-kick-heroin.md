I was flipping through an old issue of <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/">Wired</a> and came across <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.04/bupe.html">this article</a> about rapid-detox.  In particular, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/images.html?issue=13.04&topic=bupe&img=1">this image</a> caught my eye.

"Hrm," I thought to myself.  "In ten years, this stuff will be cheap enough that I can safely try heroin and just use this if I get myself hooked!"

Then I considered what a disturbingly maladjusted idea that was, and the fact that other people might think the same thing.  Certainly, it would be great to cure addicts of their junk habit, but doesn't something this simple just erode the arguments against trying harder drugs in the first place?
