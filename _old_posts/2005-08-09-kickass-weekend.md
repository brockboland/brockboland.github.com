I know it's Tuesday already (I've always been a couple days behind), but this past weekend was probably the best of the summer.

It started on Wednesday with a few drinks and a viewing of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115819">Cannibal: The Musical</a> at Lux.  I was surprised by how many people I knew there, but I'm not sure if they were there for the movie or my friends just hang out at bars on Wednesday nights.

Thursday was, of course, the Flogging Molly show, but I've already said <a href="/2005/08/flogging-molly-round-two">quite enough about that</a>.

After four and a half hours of sleep and a full day at work, I was pretty beat by the time we headed to the Flour City Brewer's Festival Friday night.  About 20 different local breweries were there, so we spent the evening sampling beers.  I ran out of steam a couple hours in, but it was fun.  I can't even remember what beers I liked or didn't, but I do know that Magic Hat Number 9 seemed overrated.  After drinking for a few hours, we headed back to my place to meet us with people and head to Regal for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377818">Dukes of Hazzard</a>.  It was a lot better than I thought it would be, but I think we all braced ourselves for the worst and couldn't possibly have been let down.  It certainly wasn't the Dukes, though - it was as if someone explained the characters to someone who had never seen the shown and let them write a script.  Why was Uncle Jesse telling jokes?  Why was Rosco so devious and competent?  Why was it set in modern day?  Why was the product placement so obnoxious?  Whatever happened to button-up flannel shirts?  Either way, it was funny, and there were lots of fights and car chases, and I was half-drunk, so I was happy.

On Saturday night, we hosted the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/713663/">Redneck Party</a>, which wasn't as well-attended as I'd expected, but a lot of fun nonetheless.  We lost some money - less people came, but drank more beer - but that'll happen.  My brother and his girlfriend made it up, which was great.  We drank and danced and drank some more, then made breakfast for everyone who spent the night.  I'm hoping we can have a couple more parties before I leave in November, because they're always worth the time and money we put into them.
