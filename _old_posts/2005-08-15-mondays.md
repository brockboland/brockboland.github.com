<a href="http://www.blogbp.com/">BP</a> bought himself a remote controlled blimp, the Fantastic Flying Funship.  Apparently this thing was like the hallmark of his childhood, so he found one online last week.  I haven't been able to find a website - I'll take pictures later.

RJ is back in town.  He moved into his new place this afternoon, but got bored all by himself.  With only a rough approximation of our apartment number, he started driving around UC until he saw us outside smoking.  I was really glad we ran into him, because that kid's always fun to hang out with.

We took the blimp outside.  RJ and I wrote a theme song for it.  It's fantastic.
