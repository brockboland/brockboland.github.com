Wednesday was my last day of co-op.  I'm really glad I got the job and decided to stay for a second quarter, because I liked working with those guys and learned more than I could have expected.  I got to do some projects I really loved, and one or two I hated - sometimes, that's even better, because it's good to know what you DON'T want to do before you take a job doing it.  I'm still going to be working for the college, supporting the EMBA program on Saturdays.

It always takes a week or so to get used to working full time.  This past six months was the longest period that I've worked for - I usually only work full time during the summer - so going back to a class schedule is going to be a weird transition.  I'm looking forward to the variety of classes, though; it will be a nice three-month break between co-op and the real world.
