When the computer won't boot, take one drink.

When the computer doesn't make it past POST, take two drinks.

When the new motherboard you buy doesn't fit in the case, take a couple more drinks.

When the next motherboard you buy has a no-return policy, cross your fingers and do a few shots.

When it works on the first try, cry a little bit and move your drink away from the open case.
