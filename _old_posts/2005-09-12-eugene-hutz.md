This weekend I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436078/">The Aristocrats</a> at <a href="http://www.little-theatre.com/">The Little</a> with some people from work.  One of the previews was for <a href="http://wip.warnerbros.com/everythingisilluminated/">Everything is Illuminated</a> (which, as it turns out, was made two years ago).  The Ukrainian guy looked so familiar, but I couldn't place him.

I was reading a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/wickidpisa/126890.html">post from Tom</a> when I saw <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/drivebyluna/">Tracy's</a> <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/34619748/2479226">icon</a>, which sparked my memory and reminded me to look into it.  According to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0404030/">IMDB</a>, his name is Eugene Hutz, and he is (gasp!) the lead singer for <a href="http://www.gogolbordello.com/">Gogol Bordello</a>.  It's no wonder I recognized him: I just saw him up close and personal <a href="/2005/08/flogging-molly-round-two">last month</a>.

I'm looking forward to seeing that movie.
