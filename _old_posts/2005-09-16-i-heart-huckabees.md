I knew that I'd enjoyed <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/">I Heart Huckabees</a> when I saw it last October, but I had forgotten how much.  I really think it's the best movie I've seen in the past year or two.  I can't think of any specific reason why I like it so much - half the time, the existentialist crap doesn't make any sense, but it's executed so well and the jokes are perfect.  The cast is fantastic, especially <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000242/">Mark Wahlberg</a>.  I need to pick up the DVD one of these days.
