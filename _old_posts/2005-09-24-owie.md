Wednesday, I played racquetball for two hours.

Thursday, we had a hockey game.

Yesterday, I played racquetball for two more hours.

Today, I hurt like hell.

My torso's the worst part.  I never thought it was possible to ache in places I ache; usually my chest hurts, either from sickness or a pulled muscle, but this time it's my gut.  My sides hurt when I cough.  I also pulled an ass muscle earlier this week - not as bad as a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/brocklisoup/502480.html">groin muscle</a>, I assure you - but it's still bothering me.  And of course, my arms and legs hurt from running and shooting and skating and swinging.

I feel old.
