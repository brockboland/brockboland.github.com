I don't think I've ever failed a test.  Homeworks and scores of quizzes, to be sure, but never a test.

But really, who needed to know the development of the symphony from the 1740's to 60's?

On the upside, I can re-write the essay on said symphonic development to bring my grade up as high as a 72%.  Otherwise, I've guaranteed myself a B or lower in the class.
