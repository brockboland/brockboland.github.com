I support two different classes during my Saturday job, but not at the same time.  The classes meet every other week, so as far as I'm concerned, they just alternate.

The class that's here this week has only 9 students, so I don't have a lot to do.  My plan was write that <a href="/2005/10/whoops">damn essay</a>, but I forgot to grab the book I need to do it.

Also, I've been seeing a lot of fake comment spam lately.  I don't really know the motivation behind it, but they link to random blog posts and things like that (<a href="http://anthony.ianniciello.net/blog/archives/000079.html">example</a>).  I've enable comment moderation, so comments won't appear immediately.  Apparently, <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/">MT 3.2</a> has pretty good built-in spam blocking, so I think I'm going to upgrade today.
