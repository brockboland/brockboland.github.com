Last night, in one of my dreams, the battery in the clock above my bed died.

This morning, I woke up and added AA batteries to my shopping list.

Just now, I walked into my room and thought, "I wonder if I have time to go shopping now and get the stuff on that list."  I glanced up at the clock and found that it died six hours ago, at 11:35 this morning.

Whoa.
