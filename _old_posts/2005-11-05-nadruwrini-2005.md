Don't forget, everyone!  Tonight is <a href="http://abroad-abroad.org/index.php/2005/10/09/blogging-while-intoxicated/">National Drunken Writing Night</a>!  I, for one, will be starting with Evan Williams and Coke and making my way to Honey Brown or Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss once I've had enough liquor.

I hope that you'll all join me and write something absolutely ridiculous once you've got a few drinks in you tonight.  Cheers!
