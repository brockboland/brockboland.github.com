I chose to participate in <a href="http://abroad-abroad.org/index.php/2005/10/09/blogging-while-intoxicated/">NaDruWriNi</a> because it's way easier than <a href="http://www.wriashorstorwe.org/">WriAShorStorWe</a> and a hell of a lot shorter than <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, and I do it anyway.

eal quick: rules say that you can't do any post-editing, just back-spacing as you go, so much of this will (hopeully) be totally incoherent.

I've considered a few things I'd like tow rite about, but I feel it would be better just to write about my evening.  The important things I want to write about deserve sober attention and at least a cursory once-over before their presentation to the masses at large.

As such - I've had a delightful evening!  I've only got one more weekend left in my colege career, so I knew I should make the most of this one, but I dind't.  As I've mentioned (go find it yourself, I don't feel like linking), I work all day Saturday, so my Friday evenings are quite dull.  As such, my only option fo rmerry-making is Saturday night.  Knowing that NaDruWriNi was upon us, I started drinking around 6:30 with my roommates Sara and Fonny.

Lucky for me, there was an Ultimate Fighter marathon on tonight.  I'm not fond of reality TV, but I love wathcing guys beat the snot out of each other, so this show worked out for me.  I watched it with roommates, and visited some friends, and some friends came to visit, and we had outstanding conversation, and it was, on the whole, a woinderful evening.

However.

I graduate in two weeks, and this fact has not been anywhere but the front of my mind at any point this quarter.  I feel like I should be making the most of my weekends and going out, but I'm so tired form class and work and social anxiety that I just want to hang out at home.  I worry that things will be incredibly dull once I get a "real" job and move wherever, even if it is nearby.

So yes.  My college career has been exciting, but lackluster at some points.  There's a whole 'nother post coming about that, just you wait.

And in that vein, I have a lot to talk about once I get a few minutes to articulate my thoughts.  Everything is chaning in a big way, and I'd like to write about it as it does, because in 20 yuears, I may look back at all this and use it as a basis for my memoirs.

And, as we all know, I wanna make lotsa money, so those memoirs gotta sell, baby!!

But seriously, this has been, without a doubt, the most stressful couple of months of my life.  I've always thrived on the "It'll all work out, don't bother worrying" philosophy, but this time, I really don't know where I'll wind up.  When I graduated middle school, I knew where I was going.  When I graduated high school, I knew where I was going and had a pretty good idea why.  Now, I know where I'd LIKE to be going and why, but I don't KNOW where I'll wind up or what I'll be doing.

I don't like worrying about things.  Life is too short to worry about things like work and money, but when you're broke and hungry, you don't have many options.

I thought my NaDruWriNi post would be FAR more amusing and drunk and hilarious, but I got a lot on my mind these days.  Drinking makes one honest, no?  I drink, and you get an unfiltered view of my soul.  I hope it was worth all the reading.
