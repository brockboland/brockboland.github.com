I love winter.  I love snow, I love doing donuts in the car, and I love sledding.  I especially like sledding while attached to a car, but that's beside the point.

I don't like that it gets dark so early.  I wouldn't even call this early winter yet, but it's already dark as night by 6:30 in the evening.  Once in a while, this works in my favor; if I've had a particularly productive afternoon, I feel like I've had a full day when it starts getting dark around 5:30.  On the other hand, if I've been slacking all day, I feel like I've wasted the day away even if it's only early evening.

Today was the former.  I sent out a bunch of resumes, did a lot of little things that had been piling up, and got some work done on a side job.  Now that classes and most of my projects are out of the way, I can start turning my attention to all the things that have been pushed aside in the name of academic pursuits.  It's dark out, and I feel accomplished, so I don't feel bad slacking off all evening.
