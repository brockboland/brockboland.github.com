I've recently started checking my web access logs now and then with <a href="http://www.weblogexpert.com/">Weblog Expert</a>.  I don't have $75 to spend on the full version right now, but the Lite version gives me some useful data regardless, including search terms that got people to my site.  The top six are (six instead of five because six is my favorite):<ol><li>eugene hutz</li>
<li>somebody shit on the coats</li>
<li>hipster pda</li>
<li>can you feel a little love</li>
<li>not wearing underwear</li>
<li>winderz</li>
</ol>

Some other good ones:<ul><li>dane cook shit on the coats</li>
<li>honda prelude</li>
<li>precipitory</li>
<li>livejournal joanna oyzon (I know a Joanna and I know an Oyzon, but they're different people)</li>
<li>more fonny videos</li>
<li>mighty taco founded</li>
<li>make a sidebar on deadjournal (wtf?)</li>
<li>lemony skinner and the unfortunate events (yes, skinner)</li>
<li>life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. so love the people who treat you right,forget about the ones who don't and believe that everything happens for a reason. if you get a chance, take it. if it changes your life...let it. nobody said t (who the HELL searches for THAT?)</li>
<li>is not wearing underwear good</li>
</ul>

And, perhaps the most telling:<ul><li>i'm unemployed</li></ul>
