This weekend will almost definitely edge out every other one I've ever had.

Sixteen years of education end Friday morning around 10 when I finish my Tech Transfer final.  That afternoon, I'm heading to the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania to spend the weekend with the <a href="http://www.grillbillies.com/">Grillbillies</a>.  Unfortunately, I have to miss the <a href="http://www.dropkickmurphys.com/">Dropkick Murphys</a> show in Syracuse Sunday night, but that's because I'm going to the capitol!  Of America!

I've never been to DC, so I'm pretty excited.  I'll be staying with wxs and Michelle Sunday night, then I have an interview Monday morning with a company in Arlington.  I'm hoping to catch up with the rest of the crew while I'm down there - maybe for dinner on Monday? - then I'll probably head back that evening.

Many many many pictures to come.
