DC is ridiculous.  The street signs are misleading if they're even there, and finding your way back anywhere is damn near impossible.  It took me two hours yesterday to find downtown.  Rent is probably twice that of Rochester, and the traffic is unbelievable.

But I like it.  I think I might move here.

Also, the Meteor Shower Party was a blast.  I'll write about this weekend later - right now, I'm paying $7/hour to use wireless at Borders.
