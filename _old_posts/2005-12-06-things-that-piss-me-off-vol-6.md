<b>Poorly Written Web Forms</b>

I'm going through and updating my address on all sorts of accounts.  I've received errors like this more than once:
<blockquote>Please re-enter your address without using characters such as the forward-slash /, back-slash \, &, etc.</blockquote>
Any programmer that would irritate the user rather than stripping punctuation should be locked in Rosie O'Donnell's house on grocery day.  The worst is requiring a specific phone number format.  Any half-decent BASIC coder should be able to re-format a string of numbers however he pleases.
