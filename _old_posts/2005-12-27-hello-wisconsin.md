I'm comin to you live from my couch!  I got me some wireless yesterday.  Lucky for me, Best Buy has the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007KDVI/104-5273398-4767922">Linksys  WRT54G Wireless-G Router</a> - the one I've been looking at - for $40 after rebates.

I took some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/1676184/">pictures</a> before I started unpacking and building furniture.  Even after spending four hours working on stuff, I don't feel like I got very far - my couch is still buried in crap and there are boxes all over.  I don't remember having this much stuff...

At any rate, it's nice having a real DVD player.  I had my iBook connected to the TV for a while, but it looked like crap.  Real wide screen kicks ass.

The apartment keeps getting better and better, and it feels more like home every day.  On the other hand, I moved in with every intention of leaving at the end of my six-month lease to get a place with Matt (and now Drew and maybe others).  I almost don't even want all this furniture, since I'll just have to move it again soon.  But I'll deal with that in six months.
