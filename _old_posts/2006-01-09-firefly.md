Before I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786">Serenity</a>, someone described it to me as a space western.  Having seen the movie and the first four episodes of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/">Firefly</a>, I can't think of a better way to describe it.  Hell, the episode I'm watching right now features a cattle drive - IN SPACE!  I almost fan-boyyed the other day when we were talking about it, it's so great.  I don't know where I'd be without Netflix.
