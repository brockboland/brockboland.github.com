There are a lot of news-related blogs in my RSS reader, including <a href="http://www.sploid.com/">Sploid</a> and <a href="http://obscurestore.typepad.com/">The Obscure Store</a>.  Every once in a while, something comes through from Buffalo or Rochester, and I check it out to see what's going on at home.  When I saw the headline "<a href="http://obscurestore.typepad.com/obscure_store_and_reading/2006/02/teen_saves_woma.html">Teen saves woman who saved his life in 1999</a>," I had a feeling I would know someone involved.  Sure enough, my buddy Kevin <a href="http://buffalonews.com/editorial/20060205/1054419.asp">saved a lady's life</a>.

It's sort of ironic.  I hang out with these guys all the time when I'm home and we do all sorts of stupid shit, but among the people I know, they're the most likely to be capable of saving a life.
