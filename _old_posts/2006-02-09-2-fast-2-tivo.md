Know what sucks?  Scheduling bill payments on your bank's site and realizing that it's going to be another tight week.  So, I cancelled my phone bill payment.

I got a landline when I moved in for two reasons:  I have an old <a href="/2005/10/45-hours-stupid">Series 1 TiVo</a> with a modem, and I didn't want salespeople and such calling my cell phone.  I figured I would get more use out of it than a couple pizza orders and calls from charity muggers, but no such luck.  I love TiVo, but it wasn't worth $46 a month.

I ordered a <a href="http://www.9thtee.com/turbonet.htm">TurboNet NIC</a> from 9thTee.com, and it came in today.  I couldn't believe how easy it was to install the damn thing - I was done in about half an hour.  It would have been 20 minutes, but I put it all back together without reconnecting the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/97700744/in/set-72057594061923156/">power cable</a> (whoops), so I had to pull everything back out.

It was about $75 after shipping - more than the phone bill, but it will pay for itself quick.
