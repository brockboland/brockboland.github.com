I had to go to an RIT Alumni site to find out that Dierks Bentley is playing at RIT the same night I'm coming in for the <a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/">CSH</a> 30th anniversary.

This sucks for two reasons.  First, no one cares about this nearly as much as I do.  I was pretty excited when I found out about it, but no one else gives a damn.  And second, I'm expecting to be at Mark's or a party that night, because I'm not driving eight hours for a concert (well, not this concert anyway).

Why didn't they have more good shows when I was there?  I have to give them credit for Dropkick and Skynyrd, but those were two diamonds in the rough.  I'll have to see if any of the colleges around here ever host shows.
