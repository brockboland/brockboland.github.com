If you don't have iTunes installed, or haven't signed up for the Music Store, you should do so just to get the free songs every week.  They typically post two every Tuesday, and I always like one (if not both) of them.

The single this week was Munich, by Editors (the British ones - apparently there's another band with the same name that's causing some confusion on the iTMS).  It's very Interpol-y, and I've listened to it a bunch of times since I got it the other day.  Go grab it - I mean, it's free, so why not?

On the other hand, you can skip Gary Nichols, because he's a little girl.
