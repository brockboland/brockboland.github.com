<p>I've never been able to read into films much - I'm always the one that just doesn't get it.  I just don't think that way, I guess, but I can usually tell when there's something to get, whether I picked up on it or not.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/">V for Vendetta</a> certainly had something to "get," I'm just not sure what it was.  Ebert <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060316/REVIEWS/60308005/1001">said it best</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Is this movie a parable about 2006, a cautionary tale or a pure fantasy? It can be read many ways, as I will no doubt learn in endless e-mails.</blockquote>
<p>The original graphic novel was written between 1981 and 1988, so it certainly wasn't intended to be a commentary on the state of international politics or the Bush administration's attack on personal freedoms.  I found <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110008105">another review</a> that just couldn't get over the anarchist elements, completely missing the point that the character in the movie was striking back at a fantastically totalitarian government, and could hardly be compared to the current Anarchist movement.</p>

<p>And then, of course, there's the <a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=49317">Jesus Freak</a> review, wherein tolerance is played off as bigotry:</p>
<blockquote>The rest of "V for Vendetta" not only depicts Christians as evil people who oppress and torture "innocent" people, it also depicts homosexuals as a persecuted, harmless minority of "nice" people. Both of these portrayals are hate-filled, false stereotypes, but the second one is actually contradicted by the secret stash of homoerotic pornography that one of the homosexual characters in the movie hides in a secret room in his house. If all homosexuals, and all homosexual activists, are such goody two shoes, how come so many of them resort to unsafe sexual practices that spread deadly diseases, and how come so many of them promote pornography, support the murder of unborn children through abortion and molest underage children?</blockquote>
<p>I'm not exactly sure how this justifies his stance that the movie portrays a "hate-filled, false stereotype," but he mentions God a lot so he must be right.</p>

<p>So yes.  We've got political motives, confused Anarchists, and a heavy dose of bigotry for good measure.  If anyone finds a decent review that's worth reading, please let me know, because I just can't decide how I feel about this one.</p>
