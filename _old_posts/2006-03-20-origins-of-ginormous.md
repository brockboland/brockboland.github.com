<p>I think I've found the oldest use of the word "ginormous" - or rather, someone else did, and posted it to <a href="http://digg.com/science/World_s_largest_number">Digg</a>.  From <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/ron/images/guiness.html">November 1977</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
An incredible, ungraspable number!  Yet we are only two steps away from the original ginormous 3????3.
