I've never watched commentaries on DVDs, because I would rather watch a movie I haven't seen than hear someone talk about a movie I have.  NBC has been showing the cast's favorite episodes for the past couple weeks, with their commentaries on the NBC site.

This week, Cox and Janitor are doing the commentary, and it's a lot more entertaining than I would have expected, and it's cool to listen to it while it's actually on TV.  I hope they do it again next week.

And since when is the Geico lizard Australian?
