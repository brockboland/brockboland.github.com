So, here's a tip for you readers: before buying a book, take a gander at the cover.  Even if it does have pictures of donkeys and elephants and that chick from <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/">Wonkette</a>, check to see if it says "a novel" on the front if you're expecting a political commentary or stories from the Hill.

That being said, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/1594489017&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Dog Days</a> was pretty good, even if it wasn't what I was expecting and was the literary equivalent of a chick flick.

Just know what you're getting into.
