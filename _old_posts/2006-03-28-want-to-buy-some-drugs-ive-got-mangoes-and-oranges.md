Have you ever seen an old short school bus converted into an ice cream truck?  I've had one parked on the street by my place for a couple weeks now.  Except it's not an ice cream truck, it's just an old bus.  And it's spray-painted white, including the side windows.  And some of the lights are busted, and it never moves.

And half the time, it's full of fruit.

I first noticed it a few weeks ago because of sign on the back window that said something like "Oranges for sale," but didn't really think about it at the time.  A few days later, I was walking by as two guys loaded fruit into the back from another truck.  "I guess he meant it," I thought.

Now, the truck hasn't moved since it showed up earlier this month.  Aside from that one time, I've never seen anyone in or near it, but half of the time it's full of boxes of fruit (like this morning), and half the time it's empty (like this evening).  I can only imagine where the guy is unloading the stuff, but I think I'm going to avoid the produce section at the nearby Giant for a little while.
