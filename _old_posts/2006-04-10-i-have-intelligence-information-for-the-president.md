I'm assuming everyone heard about the <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-white10.html">guy who jumped the White House fence</a>.  What if he DOES have intelligence information for the President?  Remember how we found out after the fact that people had intelligence pointing to a terrorist attack on 9/11?

It's sort of like the second coming of Jesus: he can tell everyone he sees, but we'll all just think he's crazy.
