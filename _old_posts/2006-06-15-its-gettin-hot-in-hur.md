It's <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KDCA/2006/5/30/MonthlyHistory.html">official</a> - we moved on the hottest day since I've been down here.

I'm surprised how much I've already gotten used to being in a warmer area (well, SLIGHTLY warmer - we're not talking Aruba).  A few weeks ago, Jym and I were going out to get boxes for the move.  We both got halfway out the door before deciding a hoodie was in order.  When we got in his car it told us the outdoor temperature: 68F.  That's beach weather in Rochester.

I can remember checking the weather on days when it got above 85F last summer and thinking, "damn, it's hot."  Now, that's just sort of a warm afternoon.  On the other hand, we haven't gotten the humidity here yet, so my tune may soon change.
