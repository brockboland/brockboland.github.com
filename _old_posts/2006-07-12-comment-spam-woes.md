To anyone who has commented lately, I'm very sorry if it didn't show up.  I've been getting slammed with comment spam lately, with mixed results from SpamLookup.  I was flushing some of it today when I noticed one real comment amongst them, but this was after nuking hundreds of comments, so I have no idea if there were other real ones in there too.  And it seems that I accidentally published a block of them instead of deleting them, so I'm cleaning up that mess now.

I'm going to keep a closer eye on things for at least a little while and see if my SpamLookup settings need some adjustment.  In the meantime, if you post a comment and it doesn't show up after a few hours - I moderate everything, so it'll be a little while, anyway - please send me a quick note so I can rectify the situation.  I'm at rboland[at]gmail[dot]com.  Thanks!
