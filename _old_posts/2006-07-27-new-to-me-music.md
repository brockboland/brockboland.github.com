<p>I spend most of my day at work with my headphones on, letting iTunes shuffle me though a musical smorgasbord, but when a new song or album catches my attention, I tend to queue it up a couple times a day.  And, since my opinions are so highly respected, I thought I'd share them with you.</p>

<p><b>Harvey Danger - Happiness Writes White</b> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000BDHKHW&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Little by Little</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000BDHKHW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
<br />
I haven't really listened to the rest of the album, but Happiness Writes White is fantastic.  It sounds kind of like Flagpole Sitta and Sad Sweetheart, but a little mellower and happier.</p>

<p><b>The Fray - Over My Head, and How To Save A Life</b> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000AA301G&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">How To Save A Life</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000AA301G" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
<br />
These two keep getting stuck in my head.  They drive me a little bit crazy.</p>

<p><b>Billy Talent - This Suffering</b> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000FFP0AK&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">II</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000FFP0AK" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
<br />
Really, most of this album is pretty good, but This Suffering is my favorite.  A couple of the songs sound disjunct, like Red Flag - the slower verses explode into a furious chorus that just doesn't fit the rest of the song.  It's a great album for the gym - the opening of Devil in A Midnight Mass is the best way to start a workout.</p>

<p><b>Ben Folds - Bitches Ain't Shit</b> (iTunes Exclusive, I think)
<br />
Ben Folds covering Dr. Dre seems like it would be funny for a little bit, but it's actually a really good song.
</p>

<p><b>Teddy Geiger - For You I Will</b> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000BN9X18&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Underage Thinking</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000BN9X18" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
<br />
Don't you judge me.  This song was the main plot point in the only episode of <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/love_monkey/">Love Monkey</a> that I got to see (which I loved), so it sort of stuck.  Plus, the little bastard is from Buffalo too, so that makes it OK, right?</p>

<p><b>Under the Influence - Mama's Room</b>
<br />
I got this as an iTunes single of the week.  They sound like Scissor Sisters on a good day.</p>

<p><b>Flogging Molly - Black Friday Rule</b> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000FUF80M&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Whiskey on a Sunday</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000FUF80M" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
<br />
Black Friday Rule is definitely better live, especially when it runs 13 minutes.  I was really looking forward to the studio version of Laura - the live version on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000EQ46R8&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Alive Behind the Green Door</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000EQ46R8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> was pretty good, but I was expecting it would be even better once they cleaned up in the studio.  Unfortunately, all the studio songs on the album are really mellow, but the live recordings are just as good as Green Door.</p>

<p><b>Silversun Pickups - Kissing Families</b> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B0009WFEF0&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Pikul</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0009WFEF0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
<br />
I have no idea where this song came from, but I came across it one day on shuffle and it blew my britches off.  I even bought the music video on iTunes.</p>

<p><b>Music For One Apartment and Six Drummers</b>
<br />
I have no idea who these guys are, but a few different blogs linked to the <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8000409016826512649">video</a> a week or two ago.  If you're impatient like me, skip ahead to 1:00 - basically, they broke into someone's apartment while they were out walking the dog, but you really don't need to know that ('course, if you're impatient like me, you started the video before getting this far).  I put this on in the background almost every day just because it sounds so cool.</p>

<p><b>Metallica is on iTunes</b>
<br />
I haven't actually been listening to them lately, but as of this week, the full Metallica catalog is available on iTunes.  A couple months ago I wanted a copy of the Black album, but wasn't willing to pay $18 for it at Borders, and went home cursing Lars Ulrich.  I'll probably grab a couple albums on there when I want them, but the urge hasn't struck yet.</p>


<p>That's it for this week.  Maybe I'll do this every week or two.</p>

<p>(I think we both know I won't.)</p>
