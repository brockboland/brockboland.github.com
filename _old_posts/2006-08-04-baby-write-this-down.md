I want to write a book.

Some years ago, I started the List of Things To Do Before I Die, but I only got as far as "write a book" and "skydive."  And since I can't afford to go skydiving any time soon, I figure that writing the book is the only thing on my list that I can do (aside from #3: "finish list").

Problem is, I don't know what to write.  I've got a couple of ideas, but one will require more money than I've got, and the other will keep me from holding down a steady job (these aren't "sit down and write" book ideas, they're "spend a year doin' shit and THEN write" ideas).

Of course, when I've actually got time to write, I wind up reading, thinking that I need to read a lot of good stuff before I can write any good stuff - a reasonable conclusion, I think.  But that doesn't change the fact that I don't have anything to write when I'm <b>not</b> reading.  My life hasn't been interesting enough for any kind of memoir, and I don't know enough about any particular subject to write much about it, except maybe <i>Getting By On Six Bucks A Day After Spending Your Paycheck The Friday You Get It</i>, but the only people interested in that wouldn't be able to afford it.

So, if you've got ideas, let me know.  I figure a best seller is more likely than landing the lottery, and I could use some cash.
