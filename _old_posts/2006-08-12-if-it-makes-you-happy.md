People who tell you "Do what makes you happy" are all hypocrites.  I know this because I know some of these people.  I spent all last week drinking rum, kicking puppies, and teaching children curse words, and then they have the gall to get all pissy at me.  I'm all like, "I'm sorry, I thought you told me to do what makes ME happy, not what makes YOU happy.  Now get out of my way, commie, I'm trying to play Jarts off 'a this bridge."
