<b>Tonight</b>
Laundry! (suck)
Packing! (not-so-suck)

<b>Friday</b>
Working my ass off till noon! (crap)
Pick up rental car! (sweet!)
Pay for rental car! (lame!)
Drive! (fun!)
It takes 9 hours! (ehhhh)
Ride Dad's motorcycle! (bliss!)
Fix parents' computer! (agony!)

<b>Saturday</b>
Cousin's wedding! (eh, if you've seen one Catholic wedding...)
Reception! (whoo!)
With my brother and cousins! (yeah!)
And a bar! ("hey ya'all, watch this!")

<b>Sunday</b>
More motorcycle riding! (double bliss!)
Drive home! (ohgodwhyisitsofar)
Sleep through the rest of August and parts of March! (wait, what?)
