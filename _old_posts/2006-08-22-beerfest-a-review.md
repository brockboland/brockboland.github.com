On a scale from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0331953/">Club Dread</a> to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247745/">Super Troopers</a>, I'd put <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486551/">Beerfest</a> at an 8.  It was pretty hilarious, but a lot of the dialogue in the first act was pretty bad, and they had a lot of cheese-for-the-sake-of-cheese later on.  But, it also featured gratuitous toplessness, so it evened out.  Plus, we went to Fado afterward, and that's always good.

I had never been to an advanced screening before, so that was pretty cool.  Apparently <a href="http://www.ytic.com/">ytic.com</a> gives away screening passes a lot, so I went and signed up for all of their contests.

I'm definitely willing to pay to see it a second time, and that's exactly what I intend to do.  I think we'll be heading up to Gallery Place Friday night after BBQ and beer drinking, since Fonny and BP will be here.

Also, my t-shirts came in from <a href="http://www.threadless.com/">Threadless</a> and <a href="http://www.oddica.com/catalog/">Oddica</a> today, so that made me happy.

As far as evenings go, I can't complain about this one.
