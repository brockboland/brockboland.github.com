<p>I said <a href="/2006/07/new-me-music">every week or two</a>, but every month or two is probably more appropriate.</p>

<p><b>Ben Folds - Still Fighting It</b> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B00005NZKK&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Rockin' the Suburbs</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00005NZKK" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
<br />
I guess this song has been out longer than I thought, but I just picked it up a few weeks ago and it's been played a lot since.  I should probably get the rest of the album, because I've liked the tracks I've heard - he's a talented fella.</p>

<p><b>Boy Kill Boy - Suzie</b> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000EBFX0W&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Civilian</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000EBFX0W" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
<br />
This was one of the free singles on iTunes a couple weeks ago, and it's been stuck in my head pretty much non-stop ever since.</p>

<p><b>Cowboy Mouth - The Breakup Song</b>
<br />
I saw these guys open for Barenaked Ladies about 7 years ago and wasn't terribly impressed, but they came back into my view about this time last year.  It's a cover of a Greg Kihn Band song, but doesn't seem to be on any of Cowboy Mouth's CDs.</p>

<p><b>General Miggs - Broken Hoof</b> (<a href="http://www.gmiggs.com/audio.html">Download it</a>)
<br />
I'm really not sure how I wound up with this one, but you can download it on their site.  It's a nice mellow tune to groove to.</p>

<p><b>The Killers - When You Were Young</b> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000HCO7QO&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">When You Were Young</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000HCO7QO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
<br />
Who HASN'T been listening to this track lately?  Apparently the video is pretty good, too, but I haven't found it online.  I pre-ordered the album on iTunes, so I'll have the video on Sept. 18 or Oct. 3, depending on who you ask.</p>

<p><b>Lacuna Coil - Enjoy the Silence</b> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000EHSVI2&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Karmacode</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000EHSVI2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
<br />
I've been on a Depeche kick and downloaded a few covers of Enjoy the Silence, and this one's my favorite.  Little slower, little moodier, little grittier - it's perfect.</p>

<p><b>My Morning Jacket - One Big Holiday</b> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">Download it</a>)
<br />
This one came on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/wired/">The Wired CD</a> almost two years ago.  At the time I wasn't impressed with anything on the disc, but I guess I kept the MP3s.  The video for this one was playing in the pub about a month ago and I made a note in my phone to buy the track, but it turned out that I had it all along.  It sounds a lot like Little Dawn, by Ted Leo & The Pharmacists, which I also recommend.</p>

<p><b>Pete Yorn - Undercover</b> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000GG4RPC&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Nightcrawler</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000GG4RPC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />)
<br />
This was also on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B000063208&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Spider-Man soundtrack</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000063208" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.  It's fantastic.  He did a signing at a book store in town a couple weeks ago, and now I'm kicking myself for not going.</p>
