<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493459/">This Film Is Not Yet Rated</a> was WAY better than I expected.  As it turns out, there's a panel of eight secret "average  American parents" who rate every movie that comes through the MPAA.  I never really thought much about movie ratings before seeing this, but those eight people have significant weight in the industry.  A movie with an NC-17 rating is difficult to market, a lot of theaters won't show it, and Wal-Mart and Blockbuster - two of the biggest video retailers in America - won't stock it.  If a filmmaker can't convince them that the movie is suitable for an R, they have a hell of a time making it profitable.

I probably wouldn't pay to see it a second time (only because it's a documentary), but I would definitely see it again and I'd recommend every see it.
