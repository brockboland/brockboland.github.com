By default, GMail puts headlines from RSS feeds at the top of the main part of the page.  I never turned it off, because once in a while it will give me something interesting.  This morning, it was a question from Ask Yahoo!: <a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/20060913.html">How many calories do you burn while sleeping?</a>

Turns out, a lot more than I thought - 549 calories for a 160-pound person's 8-hour nap.  What I found even more interesting was that an 8-hour drive will burn 1219 calories.  Suddenly, I don't feel so bad about snacking my way between DC and Rochester.

PS: What has two thumbs and a ticket to see Death Cab for Cutie with Ted Leo & The Pharmacists?  THIS GUY.
