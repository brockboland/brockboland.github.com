The first <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322802/" target="_blank">Jackass</a> was pretty awful, so I didn't have high expectations for the second one (but then, who had high expectations for the first?)  I guess it's not a big surprise that they managed to hurdle the low bar I set for them; there seemed to be less gross-out stunts (from what I remember) and more mindless self-abuse (my favorite kind).

And it was hilarious.  I think I peed a little.

Honestly, it's a wonder these guys are still alive.  They wrangle anacondas, ran with bulls, and pretty much threw themselves bodily into everything they could find (I think my favorite was the velcro truck).

Plus, any movie with a musical montage finale is OK by me.  Not $10-ticket OK, but definitely free-on-a-Tuesday OK.  Don't bother paying full price, and for the love of God, don't take a date.

(Or your kids.  Seriously?  Compulsory sterilization.  That's all I'm sayin.)
