Best movie of the year, hands down.

I never even saw a preview for it, and the only thing I heard was from (maybe?) Kidder, who said it was funny and "sort of like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265666/">The Royal Tenenbaums</a>" (one of my favorite movies, incidentally).

It was in fact funny, and was sort of like The Royal Tenenbaums, at least in its sense of humor.  Really, I don't know what else to say about it; when I see a movie I really like, I can't write a decent review - I leave with an overall "good" feeling about the flick, but that doesn't really translate well to written word.

I'm glad I convinced myself that going to a movie alone on a Saturday night wasn't totally lame, because I probably wouldn't have seen it otherwise.
