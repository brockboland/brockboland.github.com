<strong>NaDruWriNi Rock Band!</strong>
Brock: electric guitar
Katie: acoustic guitar
Laura: cowbell

<strong>Our Playlist</strong>
Metallica - Nothing Else Matters: Pretty bad.  We can only do the main part

Blue Oyster Cult - Don't Feat The Reaper: Even worse.  Laura has the rhythm of a white chick.
