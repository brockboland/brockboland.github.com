I woke up this morning feeling a little off, and just had a bad feeling about things.  By 3 this afternoon, I was coughing and sneezing, that full-body ache was starting to set in, and my head was just starting to hurt - just a little, just so I'd know what to expect.

I should be at the DAR Constitution Hall right now to see Ted Leo & The Pharmacists open for Death Cab for Cutie, but I figured that no one wants a guy coughing and sneezing through a show, and I was bound to be pretty miserable as soon as they fired up the subs.  I was looking forward to seeing Patrick and Risa there more than the bands - I like the music, but not as much as I once did, and I don't get to see Pat and Risa very often (and, of course, I knew I'd miss the $40 I paid for the damn ticket).  So that sucks.  But, as I lay here in my PJs, wondering if it would be bad to just go to sleep now, I know that staying home was the right decision.  I'm going to take some vitamins and crash early, because I really don't want to deal with a cold all week.
