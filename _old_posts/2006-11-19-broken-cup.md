For at least a few years now, I've had a designated water cup.  I use it all day when I'm home, and I put it next to my bed at night, because I tend to wake up thirsty a lot.

Until this evening, I was using a green cup exclusively for water.  I don't know where I got the cup, but I know it was the first one I managed to dig out when I moved into my old place a year ago, so it became the water cup.  I was drying it earlier and it cracked, so I tossed in the trash.  And then I kind of felt bad, because I assign disproportionate importance to insignificant objects, because hey, how much has changed in the last year?  But my cup?  My cup has been my rock.  My rock that I filled with Brita water a half-dozen times a day.

Really, this is just my way of saying that the red <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/7491573/" target="_blank">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles mug</a> of my youth is back in the game.  In the sixteen years we've been together, it's never let me down, even when I lost the lid.  I even left it at home when I went to college, and it survived until I could re-claim it the last time I was home.  Don't let me down, TMNT.

Also, weekend was wicked awesome, more on that later, pics on flickr.
