Let's hear it for four-day weekends!  Or, in my case, four and a half - my boss came around this morning and told us that if we didn't have anything important in the works, to leave around lunch time.

I know this is supposed to be the second biggest party night of the year, but I'm going to put on my pajamas, make a drink, and watch a movie.  Just like the Pilgrims.
