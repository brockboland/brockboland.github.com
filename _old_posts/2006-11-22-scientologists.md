Know what's kinda disappointing?  Flipping through <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/popup?id=884952&content=&page=11" target="_blank">celebrity Scientologists</a> and finding that actors I actually like - such as Jason Lee - are crazy.

Incidentally, I'm watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113749/" target="_blank">Mallrats</a> for the first time in years, and if I didn't know he was in My Name is Earl, I wouldn't believe it.  And I definitely can't imagine him, with construction boots and a moustache, on a skateboard.
