<p>Last night, I posted to <a href="http://twitter.com/Brock">Twitter</a> that I think I'd like to <a href="http://twitter.com/Brock/statuses/462993">move to DuPont</a> when my lease here expires, because I've always liked the neighborhood.  I got this IM later in the night:</p>

<blockquote>I've been told Dupont is the 'gay' place. like all the gays live there...just lettin ya know!</blockquote>

<p>To the person who sent it: I'm sorry, there's no way I can NOT share this (but don't worry, I won't name names).  I appreciate your concern, but I've had my shots, so I don't think I'll catch The Gay.  I'll watch my back, though, just in case.</p>

<p>Also, I can't find the the site with DC shirts, like the "DuPont is Gay" one.  Anyone have that bookmarked?</a>
