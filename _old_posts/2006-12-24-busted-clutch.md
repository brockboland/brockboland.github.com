So there I was.  My brother and I went out tonight to meet a couple of our buddies (and our buddy's cousin, and a friend of his) at a bar about 20 minutes from my parents' place.  On the way home, the clutch in my brother's truck hit the floor as we rounded a turn.

Thankfully, my parents are very understanding and we were only a couple miles from home, so my dad came and picked us up.  My brother is none too happy, of course; far as we can tell, he blew a clutch cable, and none of us knows what that's going to cost to replace.  Further thankfully, it happened right next to the town library, so we pushed it into the lot, where it should be fine until at least Tuesday.

I hope your Christmas Eve is going well.  Ours could be better, but at least we're all OK.
