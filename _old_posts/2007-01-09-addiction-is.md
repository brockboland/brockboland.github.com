I ran out of cigarettes on the drive home from the Meteor Shower on November 19.  I had three (give or take) while was at home for Christmas, and another half-dozen this past weekend while BP was here.

The urge never goes away.  I really want a smoke, but just less than I want to not walk all the way to 7-11.

I figure that's an improvement.
