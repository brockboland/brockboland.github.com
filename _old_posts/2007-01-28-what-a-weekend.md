So I bought a pack of cigarettes tonight.

And I know, I'm a terrible person, but I've been all sorts of pissy lately and I figure it's best for everyone if I just go back to smoking so I'm deal-with-able.  I installed Call of Duty so I could kill Nazis, but that hasn't been as therapeutic as I hoped.

But anyway, Casey and Matt are in Baltimore for the weekend, so a few of us went up to hang out with them at Matt's sister's place, and then we spent the afternoon today wandering around DC and <a href="http://moveon.org/">protesting</a> a little bit, and then I took a nap.  It was nice.

I'm trying to get the DC chapter of the <a href="http://www.sundaynightfilmclub.com/sub/boston/">Sunday Night Film Club</a> going.  Last week, a few of us saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473444/">Curse of the Golden Flower</a> (which was disappointing), and this week, we were going to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343737/">The Good Shepherd</a>, but I've heard it's pretty slow and boring, so I'm going to pick a different one.  But I'll keep y'all posted on SNFC dealing.
