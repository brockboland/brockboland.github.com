Have you ever talked with someone who's a little spaced out, and you feel like they're really not having the same conversation that you are?

Have you ever been on the other side of the conversation and realized that the perfectly reasonable and articulate ideas in your head just aren't coming out of your mouth right, and that you must sound like you're more than a little off, but there's no good way to explain to the other person that you're totally with them but can't, for one reason or another, express this fact?

That's happened to me a lot lately.
