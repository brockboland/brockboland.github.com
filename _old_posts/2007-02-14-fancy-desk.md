Check it out, I finally put up some pictures at work.  Picture frames are pricey - $20 for a 3-picture frame - so I got some fishing line, binder clips, and 3M hooks, and made my own damn picture hangy thingy!  I ordered these from Flickr a while ago, but I'm going to print some more over at Target sometime soon.

I also bought a new shower head.  Staying with Sarah and Ryan gave me all sorts of ideas - I tend to get stuck in a rhythm and don't even realize that things could use some changing-up.  It's little changes like pictures of friends that make my day a little brighter.
