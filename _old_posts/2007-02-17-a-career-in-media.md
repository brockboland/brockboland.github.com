I've always thought that it would be a pretty great feeling to have directed or produced a movie.  The actual directing and producing is probably a bitch, but once that's all done, there has to be an immense sense of accomplishment.

TV is probably similar; a live news or sports program is likely frantic at the time, but very satisfying once finished.  A weekly program is sort of like a short movie every week: lots of work, but a tangible end-game.

When I was finishing college, I thought I'd really like to be involved in some kind of media.  I even looked for jobs at newspapers, thinking that might be a stepping stone into the more visual world of film and television.  Obviously, I didn't wind up there, and for a number of reasons, it's probably for the best.  Even so, when watching the "Making Of" featurettes on DVDs, I can't help but think that I'd enjoy being involved somewhere along the way.  I am most satisfied with any job where I can say, "This is what I made" when all is said and done, and with a movie, there is definitely something showable at the end of things.

I don't know where I'm going with this.  I guess I just want to appear in a making-of featurette.  Someone should get on that.
