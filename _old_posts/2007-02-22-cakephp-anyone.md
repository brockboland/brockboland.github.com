I know that I don't have too many readers, but still: have any of you used <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>?

I've got a side project that I've just started with a pretty short time frame.  I program against an MVC framework at work and would like to build something similar for this project.  Unfortunately, their server is running PHP 4.4.2, which makes things a little tougher (I use 5 daily at work, so I'm accustomed to full OOP capability).  It's do-able, but I don't want to waste a lot of time getting a framework established.  From what I've been able to find, CakePHP has a bit of a learning curve, but will make things a lot easier to manage in the long run.  The problem is that I can't find any decent testimonials about it (even tried <a href="http://jyte.com/site/search?q=cakephp&x=0&y=0">Jyte</a>).  What I need is someone who can say, "It's good for this reason and sucks because of that."

Unless I find some reviews, I'm going to spend tomorrow evening playing with it.  If things don't go well, I'm down a day, but at least I'll know whether it's worth pursuing.
