The past few weeks have felt very much like treading water.  Treading water while you're holding a bowling ball.  And also, you're trying to feed an infant.  And there's a shark.

I kept telling myself, "Just get through this week," but it kept turning into, "OK, now just get through THIS week again."  For a couple days, it was, "Just get through this month," but now I've seen what next month will entail, so it's, "Just get through this month, and then the one after that, and then?  Then you can sleep for a couple days."

The air is starting to clear a bit, for this week anyway.  This weekend is <a href="http://www.shamrockfest.com/">Shamrockfest</a>, and we've got at least five people coming down for it, and a half-dozen more that are already in town, so it's going to be a rowdy good time.  It's exactly what I need right now, and Friday night can't come soon enough.
