It's become apparent that riding the bike a few times a week isn't going to cut it - I need to start working on my upper body.  I usually spend about half an hour on the bike, but someone else was using it when I went to the gym Tuesday.  I did a little time on the elliptical (I hate that thing) and lifted some weights, then used the bike when the other person was done.  I was fine yesterday, but I tell ya, my shoulders have been aching all day today.  Guess it's time I start evening things out.
