At the beginning of every year, our collective check book is marred by the collective scribble through our collective habit of writing the previous year in the date.  We're three full months into the year, and by now, everyone has got into the habit of writing 2007...except for me.  I just found that all the photos I've taken this year were happily filed away in my 2006 folder, and even tagged as such.

In other news, I've been keeping pretty busy.  It's been a nice weekend with lots of sleeping, a kite festival, and a BBQ, and I'll be seeing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445934/">Blades of Glory</a> with the <a href="http://www.sundaynightfilmclub.com/sub/dc/">Sunday Night Film Club</a> this evening.  I can't complain.
