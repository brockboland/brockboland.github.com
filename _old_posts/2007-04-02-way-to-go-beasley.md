Dear Jenna Fischer,

I thought I loved Pam Beasley, the shy girl with the cute smile, but then I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445934/">Blades of Glory</a>, and Katie Van Whatever was JUST LIKE Pam, so I think I love you.  Wanna run away to California with me?  Let me know.

Hearts,
Brock
