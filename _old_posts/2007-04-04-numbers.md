I'm not very good with number association.  When I was about nine, I decided that 27 would be my favorite number.  It was another six or seven years before I realized that it's (conveniently!) the date of my birthday, too.  And I totally picked it by chance!  Really!

And just now, I realized that the house I grew up in was number 42, which may only be significant to Douglas Adams fans, but the rest of you will hear about it in due time.
