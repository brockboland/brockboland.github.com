Have you ever woken up and thought, "Crap, I need to get up for work!  How many times have I hit snooze?"  Then you roll over and see it's only 1:40, and you're not even halfway through all the sleeping?  That happened to me last night.  It was awesome.

I also dreamt of iminlikewithyou.com.  Is that worse than <a href="http://twitter.com/Brock/statuses/26869951">dreaming of Twitter</a>?
