I've been tossing all my change into this 2-gallon bucket for the past year and a half, give or take.  Once in a while, I'd pull out a few quarters to get a soda from the machine, but since our laundry room doesn't use coins, it hadn't been pillaged for quarters.

The bucket is <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/475844681/in/set-72157600149707892/">9.5 inches across</a>, and the coins were about <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/475833616/in/set-72157600149707892/">1.25 inches deep</a>.  According <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%28pi+*+%28%289.5%2F2%29%5E2%29%29+*+1.25">to Google</a>, that's about 88 cubic inches of coins.

I took it down to the bank today and poured it all in their machine.  Care to guess how much it was?  Whoever is closest wins it all.  Or maybe a hug, I haven't decided yet.  I'll post the winner tomorrow or Monday.

Also, figure out where <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/475834052/in/set-72157600149707892/">this penny</a> came from, and you can have that too.  Here's the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/475833924/in/set-72157600149707892/">Queen's backside</a> (teehee).
