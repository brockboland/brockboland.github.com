<p>(I found this list in my unpublished entries.  I wrote it almost two years ago, on May 4, 2005)</p>

<ul>
<li>Skydive.</li>
<li>Get a motorcycle <strike>and a license to drive it</strike> (halfway done!).</li>
<li><strike>Buy a house</strike> (I think I've decided against that).</li>
<li>Have a kid (or maybe more, depending on how the first one turns out).</li>
<li>Quit smoking (haven't had one in two weeks!).</li>
<li>Write a book (maybe I'll try NaNoWriMo again this year).</li>
</ul>
