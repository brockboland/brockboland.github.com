<div class="imgRight"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/477777065/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="/files/images/477777065_6dea4f6c47_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Bucket 'a Change = $101.43" align='right' /></a></div>

So, how much was in <a href="/2007/04/bucket-change">the bucket</a>?

Honestly, friends, I'm a little disappointed in some of you.  Most of you guys were WAY off, and granted, you only had a picture to guess from and couldn't actually lift the bucket, but I gave you measurements and everything!  I think Pete's was the most reasoned response, with the coins per square inch calculations, but he was still 25% off.

The value of the bucket was $101.43, making <a href="http://j3llybellybean.livejournal.com/">Katie</a> the winner with a guess of $100.  Katie, you may collect your hug at any time (oh by the way, I decided that instead of giving away the money, I'd use some of it to get some Chinese and see a movie.  They were delicious and entertaining, in that order).

Jonson and Heewa, I suppose you may also collect hugs, but mostly just because I like hugs.  No anal.
