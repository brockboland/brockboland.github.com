This evening I went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488120/">Fracture</a> with the <a href="http://www.sundaynightfilmclub.com/sub/dc//">Sunday Night Film Club</a> (though it was less "club" and more "me and Brian").  It was alright, but not good enough to warrant a second viewing.

But that's not the important part.  The important part is that one of the previews was for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427327/">Hairspary</a>, with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000237/">John Travolta</a> playing the role of the mother.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0427327/Ss/0427327/hs6.jpg.html?path=gallery&path_key=0427327">No, seriously</a>.

I turned to Brian and asked, "What the hell happened to Travolta's career?"

And I think he summed it up nicely: "Scientology."
