Dear NBC,

<a href="http://www.nbc.com/TGYH/">Thank God You're Here</a> would be about twelve times funnier if you got rid of the host and the judge - who, incidentally, are far more irritating than entertaining - and gave the time to the four guest stars, who are usually hilarious.  The final sketch, with all four of them, is the funniest part, and every time that Canadian dude hits the buzzer, I just want to drop a deuce on the floor of his green room.

Hearts,
Brock
