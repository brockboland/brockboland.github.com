I was told to grab a taxi from the airport to my hotel, up by Fisherman's Wharf, which would run something like $60.  But I'm an economical young man, so I took the BART to Powell St and got a cab there.  Grand total: $21 with tip.  Someone should just give me the $40 remainder for being so awesome.

My hotel is just a couple blocks from Fisherman's Wharf.  I kinda figured I'd find a dozen sushi places over there, but no such luck - not on the main drag, anyway.  I stopped into Lou's, a blues joint, and got salmon stuffed with crab and shrimp.  Want to know what heaven tastes like?  It tastes like salmon stuffed with crab and shrimp.

It's only 9:30 here but I'm exhausted.  I took off my belt when I got back to the hotel and walked right out of my jeans.  I'm not sure if I bought jeans that are too big or if I lost weight, but I'm going to assume that the heavenly salmon took off 10 or 15 pounds.

Tomorrow and Friday I actually have to work.  On Saturday, there's this <a href="http://www.kfog.com/kaboom/">KFOG</a> concert literally blocks away from where I am.  It's like my very own welcoming party with fireworks.

Before I go to bed, I need to do some ironing.  I'm not good at ironing, but I think it will be worth it - these khakis I brought make my ass look like salmon stuffed with crab and shrimp: heavenly.
