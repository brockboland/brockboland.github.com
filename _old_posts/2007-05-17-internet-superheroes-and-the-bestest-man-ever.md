On the way home from work, I ran into <a href="http://www.justin.tv/">Justin.tv</a>.  I knew I should have made my Internet Celebrity Bingo sheet before coming out here.

Then I talked to my brother, and he asked me to be his best man.  That means I'm best-manning twice next summer, so I think that makes me Bestest Man, even though I have no idea what I have to do.  But, no one else seems to know what they have to do either, so I guess we'll all figure it out.

Does anyone know where I can get a Best Man patch like the one Owen Wilson had in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463034/">You Me and Dupree</a>?
