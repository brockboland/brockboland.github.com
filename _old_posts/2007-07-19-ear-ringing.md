<i>Y'know that ringing in your ears? That 'eeeeeeeeee'? That's the sound of the ear cells dying, like their swan song. Once it's gone you'll never hear that frequency again. Enjoy it while it lasts.</i>
-- Julian Taylor, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634/">Children of Men</a>

Anyone know if this is true?
