I'll definitely have more to say about this later, but the new <a href="http://www.friendlychristian.com">Friendly Christian</a> blog (a response to the <a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/">Friendly Atheist</a>) asked yesterday: <a href="http://www.friendlychristian.com/?p=148">Does The Word "Christian" Make Your Stomach Turn?</a>  I haven't read all the comments, but there are some good responses (and of course, some idiots) in the dozen or so that I have.

Comments are closed there, but I'll be posting my thoughts here sometime soon.
