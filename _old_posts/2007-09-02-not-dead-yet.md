Well hello there Internet.  I haven't had much time or desire for blogging or Internetting lately.  Work is still kicking my ass, but things outside of work have been pretty great.  I'm going back to San Francisco in a couple weeks for work again, then out to Vegas for the last week of October, and then I'm hoping to take a week or two off because I need it.
