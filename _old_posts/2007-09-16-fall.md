Me: I just slept for thirteen hours!

Roommate: That is awesome!

Me: It was!

Roommate: You're just in time for kickoff!

Me: THAT is awesome!

I've always liked fall.  I'm especially glad it's finally arriving this year - I can't even remember a time when it wasn't hot as hell outside.  It's time to get some apple cider and a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks and watch some football.

The other good news is that I'm feeling a lot better than I was a couple days ago.  I woke up Tuesday with what sounded like a smoker's cough, but turned into nausea, dizziness, and a gnarly headache by the time I was ready for work.  I slept all day Tuesday and went to to the doctor Wednesday to find out I had a bronchial infection.  Spent most of the week in bed, because I'd get dizzy any time I was upright.  It was Friday afternoon before I finally started feeling like I could get out of bed for more than an hour at a time, and I'm still not back to normal.  I went into the office yesterday to try to catch up a bit, but I only made it a couple hours before I started to feel like crap.

So that sucks.  I'm going to try to get some stuff done this afternoon while I'm watching football, and hopefully I'll be able to make it through a full day tomorrow.
