Just a quick update to let you know that The State of Massachusetts from the new Dropkick Murphys album, The Meanest of Times, is the song of the week.  I love the whole album, particularly Johnny I Hardly Knew Ya and Flannigan's Ball, but State of Massachusetts is probably the best song they've ever done.
