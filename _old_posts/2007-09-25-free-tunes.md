Dear Ticketmaster,

I just bought tickets to see <a href="http://www.street-dogs.com/">Street Dogs</a> open for <a href="http://www.tigerarmy.com/">Tiger Army</a> and you offered me a free sampler disc from iTunes.  Bloc Party, Finger Eleven, and a Kaiser Chiefs single I didn't even know about?  Right on!

Thanks,

BrockLi
