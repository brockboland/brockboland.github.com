Has anyone figured out how to download pics from viewmymessage.com?  I really want to keep some of these pictures people have sent me, but I can't figure out any way to get them out besides taking a screen shot of the thumbnail they show there.

Also, what are the chances that MMS support will be added with an iPhone software or firmware update?  That seems like the kind of thing that could be added without needing new hardware, and something a lot of people would appreciate.
