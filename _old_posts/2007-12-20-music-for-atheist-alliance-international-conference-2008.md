To the organizers of the Atheist Alliance International Conference:

<a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/12/13/greydon-square-live-performance/">Greydon Square</a> was good this year, but I hope you're thinking bigger for 2008.  May I suggest <a href="http://badreligion.com">Bad Religion</a>?

Get back to me.

Hearts,
Brock
