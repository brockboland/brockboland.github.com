It's my new philosophy: life is just too short for this shit.  You only get to live once.  Life expectancy is somewhere around 70 years, but there's no guarantee that you won't get hit by a bus tomorrow - better make good use of your time now, right?  Enjoy it while you can.

Of course, my philosophy has a subtitle: Everything In Moderation.  Life is short and you should enjoy everything you can...except for heroin, OK?

Go have fun while you can, and get high on life.  Or marijuana, I'm OK with that one too (also, booze).
