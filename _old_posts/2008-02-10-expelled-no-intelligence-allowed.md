Wow, Ben Stein has lost it.  He has a new documentary coming out about intelligent design and the way it's cast aside among real scientists...and how that's a <i>bad</i> thing.  Watch the trailer:

If that's not enough, there's <a href="http://www.expelledthemovie.com/blog/" rel="nofollow"> a blog</a>, too.
