I learned something important today: hurling is WAY more badass than the field hockey the neighbor girls played in their front yard when I was growing up.  I only just found out that it's not the same thing.

I went looking for info because I saw a flier the other day for the <a href="http://wdcgaels.com/">Washington DC Gaels Gaelic Athletic Association</a>.  I'd like to go watch some of their matches one of these days - it looks like it would be fun to see up close.
