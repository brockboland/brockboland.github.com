Erin likes Heinz ketchup, not Hunt's.  I have never been able to keep this straight because I grew up on a 15-house dead-end street, two doors down from Mr. Hunt and across the street from Mr. Heinz.

How do I remember which one to buy?  Mr. Heinz used to go for long walks all the time, and Mr. Hunt was a woodworker.  Erin likes to take walks; woodworking, not so much.  So, I buy Heinz.
