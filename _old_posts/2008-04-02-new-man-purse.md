It's been a long time since I <a href="/2008/01/man-purse-lust">started looking for a new man purse</a>, and I finally found a suitable replacement: the <a href="http://www.ogio.com/product.php?product=455">OGIO Hip Hop</a> messenger bag.  It's the perfect size, and unlike most bags I've looked at, it's got a water bottle pocket.  In fact, it's got TWO water bottle pockets, just in case.

My only complaint is the strap.  It's got these little plastic square loops that connect the strap to the bag.  It should look like this:

Unfortunately, it gets twisted up a lot like this:

But, I found a simple solution: a four-dollar carabiner from the hardware store:
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/2384168104/" title="How it works now by BrockLi, on Flickr"><img src="/files/images/2384168104_e7e48ae9d0_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="How it works now" /></a>

It still bunches up on the bag side, but it doesn't get twisted up when I adjust the length of the strap.  Once my <a href="/Crossbuster.php" onclick="window.open('/Crossbuster.php','popup','width=200,height=200,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">Crossbuster</a> patch gets here and sewed on, I'll be happier than a ternader in a trailer park.
