<p>I've tried out a lot of podcasts in the past year or so, and a lot of them are decidedly mediocre.  These are the ones that have proven they're worth keeping in iTunes.</p>

<a href="http://www.diggnation.com/" target="_blank"><b>Diggnation</b>
<img alt="Diggnation" src="/files/images/diggnation.jpg" width="267" height="150" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a>
<p>Diggnation is hosted by Digg founder Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht, and covers some of the most popular stories from Digg.  The two of them sit on a couch with their laptops and drink beer while discussing news stories.  You definitely want to get the video version of this one.  Posted weekly.</p>

<p>The Totally Rad Show is just that: rad.  It's hosted by Alex Albrecht (of Diggnation) along with Dan Trachtenberg and Jeff Cannata.  It's sort of a geek tour de force: they discuss movies, TV shows, comic books, and video games.  It can be a little cheesy, but they're reviews and arguments are as entertaining as they are informative.  Posted weekly.</p>

<a href="http://tv.theonion.com/" target="_blank"><b>Onion News Network</b>
<img alt="Onion News Network" src="/files/images/OnionNN.jpg" width="150" height="66" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a>
<p>A video version of The Onion.</p>

<a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/radionews" target="_blank"><b>Onion Radio News</b>
<img alt="Onion Radio News" src="/files/images/TheOnionRadio.gif" width="" height="" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a>
<p>Daily radio news from The Onion - short and sweet.</p>

<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/" target="_blank"><b>This American Life</b>
<img alt="This American Life" src="/files/images/TAL.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a>
<p>Hosted by Ira Glass, This American Life tells a variety of stories on Chicago's PRI.  The radio show is posted weekly after airing on the radio.</p>

<a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove" target="_blank"><b>Savage Love</b>
<img alt="Savage Love" src="/files/images/SavageLove.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a>
<p>The weekly out-loud call-in version of Dan Savage's sex advice column.  Dan's a funny guy to listen to, and it can be informative.  I wouldn't listen to this one at work.</p>

<a href="http://twit.tv/mbw" target="_blank"><b>Macbreak Weekly</b>
<img alt="Macbreak Weekly" src="/files/images/MacbreakWeekly.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a>
<p>A weekly roundup of Mac news, hosted by This Week In Tech's Leo Laporte, Merlin Mann, Andy Ihnatko, and a rotating band of commentators.  It's probably only about 50% Mac news and a lot funnier than you'd expect.</p>

<a href="http://mrdeity.com/" target="_blank"><b>Mr. Deity</b>
<img alt="Mr. Deity" src="/files/images/deitypod.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a>
<p>I wish this one was updated more often, because it's probably my favorite.  God is a regular guy, the Devil is his ex-girlfriend, and Jesse (Jesus) keeps pushing for an insurance plan that covers crucifixion.</p>

<a href="http://www.abigailsteendiary.com/" target="_blank"><b>Abigail's X-Rated Teen Diary</b>
<img alt="Abigail's X-rated Teen Diary" src="/files/images/Abigail.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a>
<p>Abigail is a 13 year-old girl with Bloomberger syndrome, so she looks like a 35 year-old man, but she still hangs out with her BFF Madison and has a thing for her classmate Lance.  Hilarious every time.</p>

<a href="http://midwestteensexshow.com/" target="_blank"><b>Midwest Teen Sex Show</b>
<img alt="Midwest Teen Sex Show" src="/files/images/mtss.gif" width="" height="" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a>
<p>The Midwest Teen Sex Show offers sex advice to teens.  I can't explain how funny this actually is, so I won't bother trying.</p>
