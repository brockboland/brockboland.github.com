(It's been a while since I've done one of these, at least in part because I don't bother getting pissed at much these days.  But, every now and then, someone will do something that really irritates me, like:)

<b>People who say they like all music - "except country"</b>

Now, there have been times when I've listened almost exclusively to country - in particular, 2003 through 2004, but that was a dark time for all of us.  I don't really listen to country at all anymore; I can appreciate a handful of artists for their own reasons, but that's not my point here.

In my experience, people that say "I like everything but country" mean "I like whatever crap is looped on the corporate-owned top 40 station in my town."  They listen to the musical range that falls between Soulja Boy and Fallout Boy, but that's like visiting every town between Boise, Idaho, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama: there's a little variety, but it's all pretty boring and you still won't come across any oceans, let alone Paris, London, or even New York.

Seriously, just be honest with yourself and just admit that you own every Nickelback album - because hey, they're not country, right?
