Here's a neat trick I didn't know about.  I already knew that hitting Command+Shift+3 will take a screen shot, and Command+Shift+4 will allow you to select an area of the screen to shoot.  But if you hit Command+Shift+4, and then hit Space, you can take a shot of a single window without having to carefully select it.
