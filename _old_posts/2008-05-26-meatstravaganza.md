Yesterday, I went the [Dupont Circle Farmer's Market](http://www.freshfarmmarkets.org/markets/dupont_circle.html) with Erin and her sister Meghan.  We picked up some fruits and vegetables, fresh bread, and - more importantly - buffalo burgers, lamb sausage, and lamb steak.  I wanted to put something in the fridge to thaw for dinner tonight, so I asked Erin if she wanted buffalo or lamb for dinner.

"Why can't we do both?"

"What, like one for lunch and one for dinner?"

"Yeah, we'll just eat meat all day."

Have I told you, dear Internet, how much I love this woman?
