I fumbled my iPhone good today.

Erin and I were waiting for the bus to go kayaking.  I had just put on sunscreen, so my hands were all slippery when I went to text Aubri, and it just spilled out and landed face-down on the sidewalk.  We both kind of looked at it for a second, not daring to pick it up and see the damage.

My first thought was, "Well, I guess I'm upgrading after all."  I had no intentions of getting the 3G version any time soon - what little money I have is much needed elsewhere.  But then I realized that thousands of OTHER people are upgrading - and selling of their old ones in the process.  I could just get a used one and drop in my SIM card.

Unfortunately, used first-gen iPhones are running about $250 on Craigslist here, and my search for "iPhone" returned a lot more want ads than sale ads, so it's safe to say that demand is high enough to keep prices higher than I want to pay.  Or I could pay $200 to get a brand-new 3G, at an extra $10/month for the data plan - an extra $70 over the course of the next year.

Either way, it sucks.  I really don't want to spend money on a phone right now.  I suppose I could just get a super-cheap regular phone, but after having an iPhone for 10 months, could I ever go back?  On the other hand, I'll bet I would be able to receive MMS.

The screen is hard to read, but it still works, so I think I'm going to give it a week.  I'm just hoping that prices on used phones will fall a bit, which might be a little too optimistic, but we'll see what happens.
