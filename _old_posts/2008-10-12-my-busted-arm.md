So, I might have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.  What fun for me.

My right wrist and forearm started bothering me a couple weeks ago.  I twittered about it at some point, and the illustrious [Brian Flores](http://unqualified.org/) sent me some info on stretches he does and gave me advice on my desk setup.  I did get a new [keyboard](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=043) and [mouse](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=086) for the office, and I'm still trying to learn how to type properly.  Over the years, I developed my own frantic, flailing means of typing, which probably caused this mess to begin with.

This past Thursday, I saw a doctor about it, and it only took her a minute to decide it was properly carpal tunnel.  She prescribed an anti-inflammatory med and told me to get a wrist brace.  If those don't help in the next couple weeks, I have to see an orthopedic surgeon.

Now, I'm trying to type the right way, while [wearing a wrist brace](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/2926818781/), so it's both slow AND uncomfortable.  I find myself reluctant to open anything that will require typing - e-mail, blog posts, code - because it's frustrating either way.  If I don't wear the brace, my wrist hurts like hell.  If I do wear the brace, I can barely function.  Everything is a pain in the ass.  Hopefully, the meds and brace will help get me back to normal, and I'll get used to typing the right way.
