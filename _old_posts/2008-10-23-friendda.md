From [Rands in Repose](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2008/10/19/friendda.html):

> A by-product of obsessively, constantly surfing the net to discover the bright and the shiny is a steady flow of promising new ideas. Mostly slight variations on existing great ideas that tickle your fancy. For example, after staring at Twitter for nearly two years, I’m guessing I’ve had a dozen bright ideas about Twitter-inspired products. These ideas tend to show up in the morning during the drive, after appropriate caffeination, and more often than not they fade the moment I walk into the office.

I'm glad someone else agrees with my justification for obsessively Internetting, and I **love** the [FriendDA](http://www.friendda.org/).
