I've been a pretty crappy friend lately. A great many things have kept me from keeping in touch with far-away friends, and fewer things have kept me from seeing local friends as much as I really should. As more time passes, I feel like I need to do more to catchup with those long-lost friends, but the extra time it would take to do it proper keeps me from doing anything. 

Personal projects have suffered for the same reasons. I always seem to have something more pressing and important that needs to be done, so my projects and friends get put off a little longer, and now simple inertia keeps me moving further away from both. 

I'm working on it, friends.  I keep hoping that if I just keep chugging away on this endless todo list of mine, I'll finish the things that **need** to be done, so I can get back to having fun.
