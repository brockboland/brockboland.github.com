As I rode the shuttle into the office this morning - later than usual, because I was up late and overslept - I realized that, for the first time in years, I was not ashamed to be an American.  This election was so much more decisive and satisfying then the last two, and I finally feel like maybe the rest of the world will no longer see us as a nation of warmongering racist illiterates.  I can't remember ever feeling this hopeful about the future.
