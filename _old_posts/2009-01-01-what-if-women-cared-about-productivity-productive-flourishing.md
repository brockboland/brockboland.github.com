An interesting read on Productive Flourishing: <a href='http://www.productiveflourishing.com/what-if-women-cared-about-productivity/'>What If Women Cared About Productivity?</a>
<blockquote>
Please understand me here: I’m not coming from the position that women actually *get* life and what’s important and are the saviors of humankind. That would just replace one socially-indoctrinated form of sexism with another form of sexism. I am saying that having the perspectives of half of the population who are socialized to be concerned about different facets of the human condition would make our discussions of productivity, progress, and personal development more informed, interesting, and useful.
