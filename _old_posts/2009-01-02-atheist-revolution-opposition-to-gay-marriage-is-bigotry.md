Another good one from Atheist Revolution: <a href='http://www.atheistrev.com/2009/01/opposition-to-gay-marriage-is-bigotry.html'>Opposition to Gay Marriage is Bigotry</a>.</p>			

<blockquote>
<p>Does Opposing Gay Marriage Make One a Bigot?</p>
<p>Before responding, consider the following:</p>
<p>Does opposing African American marriage (i.e., defining marriage as between two whites and seeking to prevent two consenting African Americans from being married on the grounds that they are African American) make one a bigot?</p>
