I like this:
<blockquote>
<p>I find that most people take on new jobs, projects and hobbies for three reasons:</p>
<p>   1. To learn something new</p>
<p>   2. To pay the bills</p>
<p>   3. Because they love doing it</p>
<p>These three things fulfill some of our very basic needs—they give us stability, excitement, ways to contribute and opportunities to grow. If you’re with me so far, then allow me to present exhibit A, the love-growth-cash triangle.</p>
