I'm just going to be honest here: I don't really feel like doing the year-end wrapup.  

2008 was alright.  It had its ups and downs.  Erin and I got engaged.  Loved ones got married.  Work was busy.  It seems like there should be more to it, but the year went by so quick and in looking back, there aren't a lot of times that stick out as great or terrible.

2009 has a lot of promise, though.  We just got the keys for our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/72157612080164937/">lovely new apartment</a>, which we'll be moving into over the course of the next two weeks.  Said apartment allows dogs, and we'll be adopting Erin's parent's dog <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/3159448139/">Lola May</a> in a few months.  And we get married in September, then spend a week on a cruise in the Caribbean.

I didn't make any resolutions this year.  The perennials are still there - eat better, lose weight, save more money - but I'm still not sure what my goals are for this year.  I'm torn between the seemingly diametric desires to accomplish more and relax more.  I want to make more time for personal projects and do more volunteer work, but I haven't read a book in months and I barely see my friends as it is.  I feel like 2008 didn't give me enough time for all the things I wanted to do, but I'm still not sure how to fix it in the new year.

Still, it's going to be a good year.  I'll get things done, and I'll make time to relax, and I'll get a new apartment, and a puppy, and married.  It's going to be pretty swell.
