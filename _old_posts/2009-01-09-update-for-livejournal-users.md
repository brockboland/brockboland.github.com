Friends on LiveJournal --

I'm canning the brock_blog syndicated feed.  My biggest issue with using LJ this way has always been the comments left on posts there.  I had an <a href="/portfolio/livejournal-comment-grabber">import script</a> that would copy over comments, but not very well, and I got tired of maintaining it.

I am now using the <a href="http://lj-xp.com/">LiveJournal Crossposter</a> WordPress plugin to crosspost my blog entries into my long-dormant LiveJournal account, <a href="http://brocklisoup.livejournal.com/">brocklisoup</a>.  Comments will be disabled there, but the posts will all include a link to leave a comment on my blog.

So, if you're reading this post in the brock_blog account and want to keep getting my updates, add brocklisoup to your friends list.  This is the last item that will appear in brock_blog.
