I realize that I've donated and sold a whole mess of books and DVDs in the past few weeks, and add, "Update library app" to my to-do list.

And then I wonder, do I really need to maintain a list of the media I own?  I'm trying to cut down on the clutter and get rid of things I don't use much - is it worth the time to make sure I know what I have where and how many stars I gave it?  Will that make my life any better?

I uninstalled the library app.  Seems simpler that way.
