Every now and then I notice a pixel on my MacBook Pro display that's stuck on white.  This pixel has a 1-pixel wide light gray border.  And it isn't a dead pixel in the display - it appears in different places in the display at different times.

Now, just what in the hell am I supposed to do about that?
