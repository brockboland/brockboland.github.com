Our incredibly yuppie Saturday started with Erin's haircut from a very gay gentleman at a local salon.  After that, we wandered into some little locally-owned shops and ran into <a href="http://unqualified.org/">Brian</a> at <a href="http://www.bikerackdc.com/">The Bike Rack</a> - he was getting his handlebars re-taped, I was looking into a helmet and pannier bags.  We stopped into the new Yes! Organic Market to get some food for a picnic lunch in the park.  Then it was another bike shop, a fancy chocolate shop, and our couple's massage.  We came home from there to walk our disobedient but adorable twelve pounds of fluff, showered, and went to dinner at the new <a href="http://www.vapianointernational.com/">Vapiano</a> in our neighborhood.  On the way there, we backtalked a fundie nut with a bible that was harassing people on their way into the <a href="http://www.sixthandi.org/">Sixth & I Synagogue</a>.

It was a good day.
