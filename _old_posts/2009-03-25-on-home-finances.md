I need thought I would be the kind of guy to clip coupons, but you see, Safeway includes some stats on their receipts. They tell you how much you saved with your club card, how much you saved from coupons, and the total percentage off your order. 

Now, it's like a game. Tonight, I got 34%. Not bad, and I saved about $21, but my high score is 44%. 

Seriously, what am I turning into?
