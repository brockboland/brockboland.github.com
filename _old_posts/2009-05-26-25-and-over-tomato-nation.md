<p><a href='http://tomatonation.com/?p=838'>This one's</a> about four years old, but new to me thanks to <a href='http://www.kottke.org/09/05/25-and-life-to-go'>kottke</a>.  Some of this stuff really irks me in my peers.  My favorite:</p>

<blockquote>19. Take care of yourself. If you are sick, visit a doctor. If you are sad, visit a shrink or talk to a friend. If you are unhappy in love, break up. If you are fed up with how you look, buy a new shirt or stop eating cheese. If you have a problem, try to fix it. Many problems are knotty and need a lot of talking through, or time to resolve, but after a few months of all complaining and no fixing, those around you will begin to wonder if you don&apos;t enjoy the problems for the attention they bring you. Venting is fine; inertia coupled with pouting is not. Bored? Read a magazine. Mad at someone? Say so — to them. Change is hard; that&apos;s too bad. Effort counts. Make one. Your mommy&apos;s shift is over.</blockquote>
