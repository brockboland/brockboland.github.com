I haven't got much work-work done this weekend, except for a three-hour burst around midnight last night.

So far today, I've been focusing on little things: cleaning the apartment, scanning and shredding documents, doing laundry.  Some days, I need this a lot more than I need to get the big stuff done, for my own sanity.  I've been carrying about 20 items over from one daily todo list to the next, and it often feels like I'm not getting anything accomplished.  On days like this, I need to spend a couple hours just doing the little stuff, to make some progress and knock some stuff off the list and get me started.

And for that reason, it's been a pretty satisfying day already.
