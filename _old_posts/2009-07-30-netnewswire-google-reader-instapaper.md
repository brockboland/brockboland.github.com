Earlier today, a <a href="http://nnwbeta.com/2009/07/30/netnewswire_3_2_beta.html">free public beta of NetNewsWire 3.2</a> was released.  This version syncs only with <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>, instead of <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">NewsGator</a>.  I love Google Reader, but I've always been a fan of the interface on NetNewsWire, so this is huge.

On top of that, NetNewsWire now includes <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> integration.  Instapaper is a service that allows you to save the content of a web page with a "Read Later" bookmarklet, so you can (dur) read it later.  Moderately handy on it's own - it replaced my <a href="http://delicious.com/">delicious</a> "toRead" tag - but <i>fantastically</i> useful when paired with the iPhone app, which can download the text of the articles for offline viewing.  Any long-ish articles that I come across go into Instapaper to be read on the train ride to work on my phone.

In NetNewsWire, just hit Ctrl+P to save the article to Instapaper.  The first time you do it, you'll be prompted for your account info, and each time after that it's just a quick save.  This replaces three steps for me: open the article in a new tab, hit "Read Later", close tab.

One small beta release just made my day.
