I set another personal record today - over 21 miles in one trip!  This is up from the 14.6 [I did yesterday](/2009/08/slightly-damp-ride).

* **Total Distance:** 21.27 mi
* **Average Speed:** 13.3 mph
* **Max Speed:** 24.1 mph
* **Total Ride Time:** 1:35
* **Calories Burned:** about 1300

I was only going to do two laps around Haines Point today, since I was still sore from yesterday - [two laps there](/2009/08/slightly-damp-ride) and about four hours [sitting on the lawn to see Lord of the Rings](/2009/08/two-towers-live) will do that.  But, after two and a half laps, I decided to go for it.

I'm not going to lie: I'm kind of proud of myself. Well, proud and a little suspicious.  On Tuesday and Thursday of this week, I managed two laps.  Yesterday I did three, and today I did five.  It's both exciting and a little weird that I was able to pick it up that quickly in the span of this week, but then again, I know it's going to be tough to drag my ass out there a few times a week and keep doing it consistently.  I know I've still got a ways to go before I can ride to work three times a week - it's only 10 miles, but mostly uphill - but I'm getting there.
