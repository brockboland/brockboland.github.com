<p>From <a href='http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2009/11/02/the_foamy_rules_for_rabid_tools.html'>The Foamy Rules for Rabid Tools</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Think of it like this. What if I told you that each time you wanted to save a file, you had to stand up, climb up on your chair, and jump up and down, yelling, “I would like to save my stuff now!” The first time you had to do it, it’d be kind’a fun, but after that it’d drive you bat shit crazy. It’s a similar feeling each time I reach for my mouse. I feel I’m engaging in an unnecessary task, which is always going to waste my time, because with a mouse sometimes you miss and missing is a tremendous waste of time.

It's not a post about keyboards or mouses, but I liked the quote.
