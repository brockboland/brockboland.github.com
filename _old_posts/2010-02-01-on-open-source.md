Just about every week, I see something about an open source product that I don't like. Usually it's just some admin feature that could use a couple more options. Most of the time, it's a really irritating but trivial bug, like escaping single quotes in the name of a blog (looking at you, [WordPress Âµ](http://mu.wordpress.org/)).

And every time, I think, "I should make this better and get involved in this project. Maybe this could be My Thing."

And then I remember that I don't get around to most of the projects that are **already** My Things. But someday, somewhere - I'll fix *something*.
