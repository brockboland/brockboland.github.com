Tonight Erin and I were looking at <a href="http://www.aftertherapturepetcare.com/">After The Rapture Pet Care</a> after <a href="http://asktherelic.com/">Matt</a> mentioned it <a href="http://twitter.com/AskedRelic/status/8834895867">on Twitter</a>.

And of course, I'm like, "We should sign up to be caretakers, and make some money off this."

And then I realized it would never pay out, because the whole point is that we don't believe the rapture's a'comin'. And then we laughed till we hurt.
