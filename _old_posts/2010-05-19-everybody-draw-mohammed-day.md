Check it out, I drew Mohammed. See, he's got a little "Give Peace A Chance" t-shirt. Cute, right?

I know that this will offend some Muslims, because it violates their religious laws â€” *their* religious laws. **Non-Muslims are not beholden to the laws of Islam.** Jews don't threaten people for eating pork. Mormons don't threaten people for drinking coffee. But somehow, some Muslims seem to think they can threaten people for drawing images of their prophet.

It doesn't work that way. Thankfully, we live in a country founded by men with enough foresight to guarantee freedom of speech, and I am thankful that today, thousands of people are taking a stand, however small, to say that we will not sacrifice that right.
