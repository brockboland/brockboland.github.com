For those of you who don't want to hear about Drupal and other nerdy web development stuff, fear not: I will soon be launching a separate blog for those posts.

And for those of you who don't want to hear about religion or my thoughts about it, you too should fear not: I will soon be launching a separate blog for that, too, with my lovely wife Erin.

The religion blog has been in the works longer than the Drupal one - which is to say, I've been sitting on the domain for that one longer. I'd like to make time to launch both of them in the next month or so, because I am well aware that I'm using this blog to write to about four different topics and audiences. I'll be sure to post announcements on both and details on RSS feeds for the sites, so you can choose what content you want to follow.
