<p>Tonight, I rode my bike to the gym to cancel my membership, then to Target to get a Crock Pot and some clothes. Who needs a car or gym membership when you can ride everywhere?</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/5061302342/" title="Who needs a car? by brockli, on Flickr"><img alt="Who needs a car?" height="374" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4152/5061302342_471852d250.jpg" width="500"></a></p><p>That webbed bungee thing was probably the best $15 I've spent toward the utility of this bike. I picked it up last week at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/BicycleSPACE">BicycleSPACE</a>&nbsp;(of course), and then on my way home tonight I ran into their sales manager David riding a <a href="http://www.brompton.co.uk/">Brompton</a> home from the shop. He also snapped a shot of me and the bike to prove I'm making good use of the gear I've bought there - I'll link to it if he posts it online.</p>
