We did about ten miles: north to the end of the finished portion of the Met Branch Trail, back down south and around the National Mall. I tried to do a track stand at one of the lights, started to tip over, and didn't manage to clip out as quickly as I might have. I didn't go down, but I got scraped up a bit.</p><p>When we got back to the shop, I bought myself a new saddle (the <a href="http://www.selleroyal.com/Saddle_Detail.aspx?c=5130HRT">Selle Royal Respiro Soft Athletic</a>) to replace the too-narrow one that came on the bike. Phil was kind enough to install it for me right quick, so I took it out for another fifteen miles to try it out - down the Mt. Vernon Trail to <a href="http://www.buzzonslaters.com/">Buzz Bakery</a>&nbsp;for coffee and a muffin. The saddle is definitely better suited to my (*ahem*) distinguished stature than the one I was using before, and it was a comfy ride.</p><p>This evening, some dinner plans were postponed, so I decided to pick up a few things from Whole Foods. I figured this would be a perfect use for <a href="http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/">Capital Bikeshare</a>&nbsp;(which <a href="/2010/09/capital-bikeshare">I wrote about recently</a>):</p><ul><li>Whole Foods is just over a mile away. It's walkable, but usually not worth taking the time to do so.</li><li>I only needed a few items - about half a paper grocery bag's worth.</li><li>I didn't feel like dealing with lights, locks, and panniers.</li><li>I was wearing pants. This is more unusual than it sounds. On my own bike, I need to do the pant leg roll-up.</li></ul><p>So I took Bikeshare. It was a short ride. My bag of rolled oats, organic granola, incense and hemp oil soap fit nicely in the front basket, secured by the built-in bungee cord. I didn't have to worry about lights or locks or bags, I just grabbed my helmet and went.</p><p>And I even got the share the ride! A few blocks from home, three other Bikeshare riders turned onto the road ahead of me and we rode along together for most of the way to the store. Even though it only lasted a few minutes, this was one of the better things that happened to me today: the three people on those bikes almost definitely would not have been riding if not for Bikeshare. I've been seeing those iconic ride cruisers more and more everyday, and getting more people on bikes is always a good thing. Progress!</p>
