It says a lot about the state of most customer service these days that after four helpful and friendly interactions in just two days, I'm so taken aback that I want to talk about it to anyone who will listen.

Many thanks to the lady at the Comcast office, the guy on the Verizon repair team, the deli counter ladies and the butcher at Harris Teeter. I wish I had thought to catch your names, because you're setting the bar for every other jerk I'll have to deal with this year.
