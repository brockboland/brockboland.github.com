<p>I haven't always been thrilled with the performance of the sites I host on Dreamhost, but I do like giving my money to the kind of company that will include this in their <a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/2011/04/01/dreamhost-is-now-part-of-the-endurance-international-group/">April Fool's post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So shit, <em>cPanel for everybody!</em></p>

<p>Yeah, I said shit. What’re they going to do – fire me? Well they can’t fire me because I QUIT. I’m buying a yacht and moving to Laguna Beach.</p>

<p>So shit.</p>

<p>Shitty shit.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>balls</strong>.</p>
