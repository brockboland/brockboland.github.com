(sung to the tune of Eddie Izzard's "Blasphemy" ditty)

Great news, everyone: I have been vasectomied! If that's not that kind of thing you want to hear about, well, you're going to want to stop reading right now.

The procedure was a piece of cake, but I really wasn't worried that it would be anything but. The doctor was really friendly and laid back, and really put us at ease during the consultation last month. I'll have to do another post in a week or two about the full process, though. The anesthetic hasn't even worn off yet, so I've still got some healing ahead of me.

My appointment was at 3, but they didn't bring me back into the office until about ten minutes after. They have you undress and lie on a table, then the doctor (ahem) scrubbed and shaved me. He then did the iodine-all-over thing - pretty much what you expect for a minor incision or donating blood - and gave me a couple injections of anesthetic. That was the worst part: he warned me that it was going to be a bit of a pinch ("this is the part where I make the joke about feeling a small prick, but it's just the doctor," he said), then an aching feeling ("kind of like if you got kicked in the balls, but not that hard"). Then he left for a few minutes for that to take effect.

Erin came in with me because she was curious to see how it went. They were fine with it, and the doctor said his one rule was that she had to remain seated off to the side. Not because she would be in the way, mind you: he's had wives pass out in there during the procedure, so he asks that they remain seated throughout the performance.

At this point, Erin said that because of the orange iodine, my balls looked like John Boehner. We told the doctor when he came back in, and he agreed - "conservative whackadoodle balls!"

He poked at me in a few places to make sure I was numb, then went to work. The entire procedure took maybe ten minutes. I didn't feel any pain, but could still feel pressure and things like that, so it was one of the weirdest things I've ever experienced. I mean, you know that something traumatic is happening to one of your most trauma-aware parts, but all you feel is some squeezing and tugging - it's weird. Erin was able to see most of what he did and said it was cool as hell: she got to watch him pulling out the vas deferns, cutting a piece out, and cauterizing the ends. I could have watched if I wanted to, but I thought it would creep me out too much. He patched up both sides with a couple stitches, and I was done.

After cleaning up and getting dressed, we walked out of the office at 4 exactly, less than 50 minutes from the time we went in there. Now, I get to take it easy all weekend with some pain meds and antibiotics, but I'll be back to normal in a week.

Plus, insurance covers the procedure so it will only cost me a $10 co-pay. <strong>Worth it.</strong>
