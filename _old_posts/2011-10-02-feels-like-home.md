It's perverse, but I love days like this: it's cold, it's windy, it's overcast, it's drizzling—well, I could do without the drizzle, but man do I love the rest.

For one thing, fall has always been my favorite season. What kind of person *doesn't* like the changing colors, pumpkin pie, apple cider, Halloween, and my birthday?

But the other part is just missing home, for all values of home. I always loved fall in Buffalo when I was a kid (even if I didn't much care for the town the rest of the time), and these cold, windy days always remind me of Rochester. I mean, most of every school year there was cold and windy, so how could it not?

I want to make sure I get out of the house more and really enjoy the season this year. The past coupe have flown by so quickly, because I was so wrapped up in work and everything else. This year, I need to drag my butt out of the apartment more anyway: Erin and I have been holing up an unhealthy amount and really need to get out more anyway.

Unfortunately, it seems like everyone else had the same pan as me today: walk through the cold to get chilled a bit, then warm up in and read in a cozy coffee shop. Every one I checked was packed, so wound up at the cigar bar instead. Still pretty cozy, but not great for reading.
