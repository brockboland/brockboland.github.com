Like everything else Merlin Mann does, I've really been enjoying [this podcast](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/).

**John Roderick:** I mean, this guy seemed incapable of lying. First of all, because he's a butcher.
**Merlin Mann:** He's simple.
**JR:** I mean, it's not that he's simple, it's just that I don't think of the butchering life as one with a lot of duplicity in it. It seems likeâ€”
**MM:** Tell the cow that.
**JR:** Well, they have to mislead the cow.
**MM:** That's not funny.
