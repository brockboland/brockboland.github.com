Tomorrow, Erin and I are leaving bright and early to drive up to Buffalo to spend Christmas with my family. I've pretty much resigned myself to spending the entire day in the car. In the best scenario, the drive takes 8 or 9 hours. Thankfully, it looks like the trip will be snow-free, but we'll still have the dog with us, meaning more time for potty breaks, and we'll be leaving during rush hour.

Needless to say, I'm not looking forward to that part.

I'd really rather be flying, of course, but flying from DC to Buffalo is never easy. Southwest flies direct from Baltimore, which means two trains and a bus just to get to the airport, and US flies direct from DCA at about four times the cost. Either way, it would cost us close to a grand to fly because it's the holiday season, so we opted for the much-cheaper-but-longer car rental option.

And just now, I caught myself being stupid: "If the airlines charged less, I would fly more and they could make more money!"

I can't remember where I first heard it, but I think it was a Drupal developer who relayed a potential client's comment when they declined a project estimate: "You know, if you charged half as much, you would get twice the work." The obvious answer, of course: "I'd rather charge twice as much and do half the work."

I can't very well expect airlines to submit to this flawed logic any more than overworked developers, but it sure would make my life easier.
