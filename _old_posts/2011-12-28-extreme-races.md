Several of my more-athletic-than-me friends have done the <a href="http://toughmudder.com/">Tough Mudder</a>, but that's nothing compared to the Barkley Marathon:

<blockquote>Andrew Thompson is a youngish guy from New Hampshire famous for a near finish in 2005, when he was strong heading into his fifth loop but literally lost his mind when he was out thereâ€”battered from fifty hours of sleep deprivation and physical strain. He completely forgot about the race. He spent an hour squishing mud in his shoes.</blockquote>
