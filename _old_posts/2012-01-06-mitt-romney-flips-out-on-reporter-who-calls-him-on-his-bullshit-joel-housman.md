Go watch it, and I'll translate for you.

> Did you hear what I said? I said I don't have lobbyists running my campaign, and he's not running my campaign.

"He's not <strong>running</strong> it, per se, but I won't deny that he's heavily involved."

> Listen to my words.

"Semantics will get me out of this one."

> Be more professional instead of being argumentative with the candidate.

"Presidential candidates aren't accustomed to being held accountable by the media, so knock it off."
