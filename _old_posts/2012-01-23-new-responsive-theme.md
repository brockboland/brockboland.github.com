Check it out, my site got a makeover!

I'd been meaning to re-do the theme here for a long time, and finally spent a couple hours building and tweaking an <a href="http://drupal.org/project/omega">Omega</a> sub-theme. I call it Fresh. I wanted something simple: I've always liked <a href="http://joelhousman.com/">Joel Housman's</a> theme and wanted something similar. Mine came out boring-er, but I'm very pleased with how it looks on mobile devices. If you're on a desktop, go ahead and shrink your browser window to see what I mean.
