The 2012 Oscar nominees were announced today, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/oscars/nominations/">IMDB has a nicely-formatted list</a>.

I did not know that <strong>Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published</strong> is a category, but the fact that it doesn't even include Best Picture-nominee <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454029/">The Help</a>—based on the best-selling novel—tells me that Hollywood is so bereft of fresh ideas that they can't even fit all the re-imaginings into their own category.
