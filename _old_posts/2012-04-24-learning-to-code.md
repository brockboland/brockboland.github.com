From <a href="http://blog.tommorris.org/post/21564514666/learning-to-code#fnref:p21564514666-3">Tom Morris - Learning to code</a>:

<blockquote>If you don’t know what the difference is between a hard drive and RAM, or can’t name what operating system you are using, you probably need to learn a bit more about computing before trying to start programming. If you aren’t an advanced computer user but you are still determined to learn to code, try one of the absolute beginners tutorials or one of the tutorials intended for children.</blockquote>

I mentioned this on Facebook yesterday, with the comment that anyone who doesn't code <strong>should</strong> be interested in learning how to do so. And just this afternoon, I came across the perfect starting point: <a href="http://hackety.com/">Hackety Hack!</a> If you've never programmed but have any interested in trying it out, I'd urge you to give it a shot.
