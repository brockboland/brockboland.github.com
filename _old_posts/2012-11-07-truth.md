From <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/11/07/transcript-obamas-victory-speech/">Transcript: Obamaâ€™s victory speech</a>:

<blockquote>I believe we can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggests. We're not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are and forever will be the United States of America.</blockquote>
