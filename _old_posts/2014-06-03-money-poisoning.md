[Jeff Simmermon](http://andiamnotlying.com/) on [an episode of the podcast RISK!](http://risk-show.com/podcast/freedom/), about rich people breaking up:

> My heart soared, because like: I'm a ball short. I got a touch of cancer. But, I'm quite accustomed to being depressed, alright? Like, I *will* adjust.
>
> THESE people have money poisoning, and that rots your soul from the inside out. And you gotta rub cocaine and helicopter rides and smoked salmon and shit all over yourself just to feel excited any more. I don't have that, and that feels real good.
