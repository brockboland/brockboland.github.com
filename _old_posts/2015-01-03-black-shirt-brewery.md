[Off Their Own Backs â€” Black Shirt Brewing in Denver, Colorado](http://goodbeerhunting.com/blog/2014/11/26/built-off-their-own-backs-black-shirt-brewing-in-denver-colorado):

> "We didn't want to be another brewery downtown that has people strolling in looking for a Bud Light and not even realizing that they're making the beer 20 feet away. Our thinking was that if you sought us out, and the person at the bar next to you sought us out, then chances are you two would have a great conversation because of the type of people you are."

Black Shirt was one of the breweries I visited when I lived in Denver last year, and that's exactly what happened: I wound up chatting with a couple sitting next to me at the bar, who were also trying to hit as many Denver breweries as they could. They pointed me to [Hogshead](http://www.hogsheadbrewery.com/), where I met more friendly people, including a woman from Chicago who told me which breweries to start with once I got here.
