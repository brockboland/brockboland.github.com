Marco, in [Apple has lost the functional high ground](http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground), widely quoted just about everywhere already:

> "It just works" was never *completely* true, but I don’t think the list of qualifiers and asterisks has ever been longer. We now need to treat Apple’s OS and application releases with the same extreme skepticism and trepidation that conservative Windows IT departments employ.

Yeeeeep.

I switched to Macs over a decade ago because a few friends told me how great they were for coding. I stuck with them because they were reliable. That is no longer the case, by a long shot. Quality has been going downhill for a few years, but Yosemite is driving me bonkers: it logs me out every 6 to 48 hours, like a soft crash that doesn't result in a full restart. It's not the end of the world, but it's *so goddamned irritating*, and damn sure not how it's supposed to work. If I didn't spend my days in Xcode, I'd be considering a switch.
