GitHub Pages [updated to Jekyll 3](https://github.com/blog/2100-github-pages-now-faster-and-simpler-with-jekyll-3-0) a couple months ago, but since I rarely post any more, I hadn't bothered to do any updates until today. I wiped out the sort-of-custom theme I had been using and went back to the Jekyll default, because really, who cares? I also dropped comments, because again: who cares?

I'd like to get in the habit of posting here again, but I like looking back through old posts to see what I was up to way back when, and I've been failing to keep that pipeline full for future me. My bad.
