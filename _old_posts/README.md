This directory contains old posts that are no longer published. Many of them are just aren't relevant any more, and others don't exactly portray my current feelings or opinions on various things. But, on the internet, nothing ever really goes away, so I'm not going to try to hide from the stupid things I said in the past. I may regret the things I've written, but I can't pretend that I didn't.
