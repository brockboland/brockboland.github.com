<a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000577031787/">These punks</a> totally stole my idea.  Some of you may remember <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/brocklisoup/17991.html">the keyboard</a> I painted blue my freshman year (the link on that page is dead).  It looked really cool, but at the time, I didn't consider the implications of a solid blue keyboard.  It <i>did</i> keep me from sending <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/brocklisoup/18907.html">drunk IMs</a> most of the time, though.

At any rate, I heard back from DSS yesterday - no dice.  I started panicking.  What if I don't get the CoB co-op?  Will I be able to take classes?  Will I have to take a leave of absence?  WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN?!

Thankfully, apathy quickly set in and all was not lost.  I made an appointment with a Financial Aid advisor this afternoon, and it turns out I won't be totally SOL if I wind up taking classes.  I'll get around $3000 in scholarships and grants, but none of the federal loans I usually get.  Since I'll be paying those back later on anyway, it would cost me the same thing in the long run to take a loan out from the bank to cover the rest.

That's my backup plan; I'm hoping it doesn't come to that.  When Fonny got home this evening, he found a message on his answering machin from Dave, asking me to give him a call.  I don't want to get my hopes up, but it seems like he would have just said it in the message or sent me an e-mail if they had hired someone else.  Since I didn't get the message till after 7, I'm going to call him in the morning, and we'll see what happens.

In the meantime, I have more programming than I can shake a stick at, and I'm an accomplished stick-shaker.
