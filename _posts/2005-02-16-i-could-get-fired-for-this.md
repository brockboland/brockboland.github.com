This just in - <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/02/14/news/economy/blogging/index.htm">you can get fired for your blog</a>.  Thank God CNN is there to spread the news.

Seriously, if you don't know this by now, you shouldn't be blogging.  At least this one doesn't mention <a href="http://www.dooce.com/">Heather</a> (see also, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dooced">dooced</a>).
