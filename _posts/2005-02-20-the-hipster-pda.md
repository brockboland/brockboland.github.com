About a month ago, I discovered the <a href="http://merlin.blogs.com/43folders/2004/09/introducing_the.html">Hipster PDA</a>.  The library sells 100-packs of index cards for a quarter each, so I grabbed some loose change and bought a couple hundred.  I'd keep a dozen or so loose in my back pocket and jot reminders to myself on them - mostly things I needed to remember to do.  A week later, I stopped by the book store and bought a pack of binder clips to keep them together.  The finished product can be seen to the right.

<a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 Folders</a> has since suggested a number of different tips for using the Hipster PDA, most of them focusing on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0142000280/qid=1108881093/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-8031669-4131837?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Getting Things Done</a> system.  I only got a few pages into it before I lost interest, so I never became one of the hardcore productivity nuts.  Rather than having a systematic method to it, I think it's nice just to be able to jot down notes when I need to.  In any given day, there are dozens of things I think of during class, like project ideas, upcoming seminars, mailing a credit card bill, or making a phone call after class.  I've been finding more and more that making a quick note is a lot more efficient than just hoping I don't forget about it.  When I come home at the end of the day, I pull out the stack and take care of things I need to do, or put reminders in iCal for things that are coming up.  It comes in real handy.

If anyone wants to give it a try, let me know; the binder clips only came in variety packs, so I've got 5 or 6 more of them and about 500 index cards.
