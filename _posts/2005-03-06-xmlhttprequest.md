This has been on my to-learn list for, well, about two weeks.  Even so, it's been at the back of my mind, pushing everything else out, because this industry moves fast and furious-like, so I need to get on the band wagon.

I stumbled onto <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/2005/02/xmlhttprequest-will-change-web.html">this post</a> thanks to Lazyweb, and I think he sums up my feelings quite nicely:
<blockquote>
google is no longer about search. they are about making everyone that doesn't work for them feel bad. i mean, google suggest was awesome. blew my mind. it was like magic. we now know that was only a warning shot. then they blew everything out of the water with google maps. but now the rest of us, who fancy ourselves web developers, just feel bad. like now i've got to go back to school and get a proper education. or find something else to do.
