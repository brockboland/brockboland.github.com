I expect this to become a regular feature here, because, hey, it's my blog and I'll write whatever I want.  And really, isn't the Internet just one big inter-continental forum for bitching?

Plus, a lot of things piss me off and I'm not shy about expressing this sentiment.  Just ask Goffin.

So, without further ado (I just love clich√©s):

<b>Anime girls that try to act cute all the time and say things like, "I'm small and helpless!"</b>

Most of the ones I've met are not cute.  Most of them are also pretty hefty, and several have caused me bodily harm.  You are not helpless, and you are anything but small.  Stop using smilies like ^_^.  And for the love of gob, quit giggling incessantly.  You are not six any more.  Get over it.

<b>Anime guys that act like anime girls into their early 20's.</b>

Seriously, where did these guys come from?  I don't know how they got away with pulling that crap this far into their lives.  Where I come from, the other kids beat that kind of thing out of you around the age of...your mother's second trimester.
