This afternoon, I spent like 20 minutes looking for a post that I remembered reading on <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim's blog</a> a while ago (it was during a SQL Server install, I had some time to kill).  I couldn't find it anywhere, and Google was no help.

Through an incredible twist of fate, <a href="http://www.mamamusings.net/">Liz Lawley</a> posted a link to <a href="http://addictionis.org/close/">THAT VERY POST</a> on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">de.icio.us</a> this evening*.  I was so happy I nearly wept.  That very post inspired me to try <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/brocklisoup/471301.html">shaving with a straight blade</a> not too long ago.

You see, Dive Into Mark was the first blog I ever read.  I found it by accident in late 2002 when I was looking for some info on CSS.  A Google search led me there, and I read it daily until Mark stopped writing there back in October.  I felt that loss as much as any other important person who has faded out of my life.  Over the course of two years, I got to know him well though his writing - I knew about his family, his friends, projects he was working on, things he was interested in, and so on.  For a long time, Dive Into Mark was my only window into the world of blogging, because it was a much smaller world back then ("back then" meaning a year and a half ago).  He's an outstanding writer, and I've missed reading his posts ever since he quit.

One reason Mark's writing really hit me was because of the few essays on <a href="http://addictionis.org/">addictionis.org</a>.  The account of addiction right there on the front page details my cigarrette habit better than I could ever hope to.  I remember quoting it some time ago on LiveJournal, during a brief attempt to quit.  Through sheer luck, I had found someone with similar interests and stuggles as myself, but he could articulate it better than I could ever hope to.

I intend to include Mark in an upcoming "The Internet Is Great" post that I've been poring over for weeks, but I felt he deserved mentioning today.

* Upon further investigation, I found that both <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org/">diveintomark.org</a> and <a href="http://addictionis.org/">addictionis.org</a> are registered to the same address.  It may not appear in the Dive Into Mark archives, but it WAS Mark that wrote it and I'm not crazy.
