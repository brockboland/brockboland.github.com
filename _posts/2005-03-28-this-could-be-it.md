Some people  will tell you, "Live each day as if it is your last."

These people are full of shit.

No one lives each day as if it were their last, least of all those who keep spouting the threadbare clich√©.  If today is your last, you're not going in to work.  You amass a huge group of friends and treat everyone to dinner at the best restaurant in town, on your credit card.  You go sky diving and drive too fast and cuddle on the couch and call long lost friends and dance all night and sing till you're hoarse.  You find Jesus or lose him entirely or discover a new religion that's based in love.  You don't go to work and pay bills and cook dinner and watch the news and get to bed early because you have a big meeting tomorrow.  You live for the first time in your life.

Are you living life with no regrets?
