I need less sleep.  Usually when I'm tired during the day or wake up cranky, I think I need more sleep.  With this 12-8 schedule, though, I've had no trouble getting 8 hours every night.  I'm pretty much ready to go to bed by 2 AM, and my alarm doesn't go off until 10.  Last time I was on co-op, two years ago, I would get up at 6.  I was still on CSH time, though, so I never got more than 5 hours of sleep unless it was the weekend.  Now, I'm getting too <i>much</i> sleep.  It's been working out pretty well for the most part - my most productive hours have always been from 10 - 2 at night, so I've been getting stuff done.

I need to go to bed later, because I'm sure as hell not getting up any earlier.
