Kottke's <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/03/pretending-to-be-a-cook">learning to cook</a>, and I wish him luck.  I've been living in the apartment for nine months now, and I haven't gotten very far.  This is all I know about cooking - feel free to enlighten me.

<b>Get a Foreman grill.</b>
Sorry, Jason - a frying pan won't ever make a decent burger.  It's also good for hot dogs and grilled cheese.

<b>Never make pancakes without eggs.</b>
Buy pancake mix that calls for eggs.  The "just add water" stuff isn't fluffy enough.  I recommend Jiffy Corn Muffin mix - there are pancake directions on the side, and they're the best I've had yet.

<b>Boil water, THEN add pasta.</b>
I always figured I could toss the pasta into cold water, crank the heat, and leave it.  Turns out, it's a lot quicker to boil it first and then add the noodles.  Adding some salt will keep it from boiling over, and a little oil keeps the noodles from clumping.

<b>"Pre-heating" is a tool of The Man too keep down the proletariat.</b>
Don't bother pre-heating.  I turn the over on, toss the food in, and add a minute or two to the time.  Works out fine every time.

<b>Pizza dough sucks.</b>
That shit just <i>won't</i> cooperate.  Call Dominos.
