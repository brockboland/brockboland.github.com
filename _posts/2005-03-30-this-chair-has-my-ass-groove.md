My iBook brings me whole new levels of lazy.  I have the Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection client on here, so I can connect to my desktop from it.  Sitting in the living room, reading LiveJournal, and someone mentions a song.  Rather than get up and walk all the way to my room, I can RDC to my desktop to download the song.

If my camera weren't all the way in my room with my desktop, I would take a picture from my seat to show you just how far we're talking here.
