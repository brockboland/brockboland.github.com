My guilty pleasure lately has been bad sitcoms.  I don't have any justification for my actions - sometimes, you just need to watch mindless TV.

It started with the Friends spin-off <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/Joey/">Joey</a>.  I only watched it the first time because I was so into Friends last year.  It's really not a good show: Joey is the only one from the original cast, he moved from New York to LA, and the episodes thus far really don't make the viewer care about the characters.

Regardless, I can't stop watching it.  It's like some cheap drug that makes you giggle for half an hour.  Even as I watch it, I'm thinking <i>This is crap</i>, but I download a new episode every week.

My most recent addiction has been <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/LifeonaStick/">Life on a Stick</a>, starring <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0278096/">the burger punk</a> from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247745/">Super Troopers</a>.  No one that saw the commercial thought it would be any good.  This show is so scripted and so canned that I can't help but enjoy it.  It's like a half hour of one-liners: none of it feels like conversation, but it's still watchable.  Most of the actors seem to realize their lines are absurd and deliver them the same way most of my friends would deliver a deliberately corny joke.  There's no flow and it's mostly crap, but I love it anyway.

There are only about a half-dozen shows I watch on a weekly basis - <a href="http://tvtome.com/ArrestedDevelopment/">Arrested Development</a>, <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/MalcolmintheMiddle/">Malcolm in the Middle</a>, <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/Simpsons/">The Simpsons</a>, and <a href="http://www.tvtome.com/Scrubs/">Scrubs</a> fill out the list - so these are the only two that I divulge in for now.  I'll keep you posed on crap TV you just can't hate.
