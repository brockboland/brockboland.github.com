According to MT's Activity Log, the following are recent searches on the site:

<ul>
<li>samsung</li>
<li>g</li>
<li>right</li>
<li>poop</li>
</ul>

I'd like to think I'm the Internet's leading authority on Samsung or (preferably) poop, but Leading Authority on Chewed-Up Pencils and Rotating Doors was the best one left when I finally got around to choosing.

And to clarify, <a href="/2005/04/back-where-i-come">I'm not moving back to Buffalo</a>.  Yet.  I will be spending the summer in Rochester, doing the same job I'm doing now.  The whole company hootenanny is to take place AFTER college.

Just so we're clear.

(Also, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Ahootenanny&">hootenanny</a> is a real word.)
