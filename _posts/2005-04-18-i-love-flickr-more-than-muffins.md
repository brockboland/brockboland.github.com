...and I am a man who loves muffins.

As you may recall, I <a href="/2005/04/flickr">upgraded to a Flickr Pro account</a> a couple weeks ago.  I received this e-mail this evening:

<blockquote>
Hi BrockLi!

You may have heard on the grapevine that we planned to reward our dear Flickr members who bought a Pro Account in the early days. Well, it's true! And since you're one of those lovely people, here's a little something to say YOU ROCK!

1. Double what you paid for!
Your original 1 year pro account has been doubled to 2 years, and your new expiry date is Apr 4, 2007.

2. More capacity!
Now you can upload 2 GB per month.

3. 2 free Pro Accounts to give away to your friends!
This won't be activated for a day or two, but when it is, you'll see a note on your home page telling you what to do.

Thank you so much for putting your money where your mouth is and supporting us, even while we're in beta. Your generosity and cold, hard cash helped us get where we are today.

Kind regards,
The Flickreenies.
</blockquote>

Furthermore, they've <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2005/04/new_prices_free.html">lowered the price for Pro accounts and improved free accounts</a>.

I really love those guys.
