I met with an academic advisor today and found that I could cut my remaining credits from 26 to 20 by switching over to the new curriculum they're introducing for this coming fall.  This means I'll be taking one class this summer, while on co-op, and finishing at the end of fall quarter.  I had to talk to the Bursar, Registrar, and Financial Aid to get it all straightened out so I could register - I still owe them money, so there was a hold on my account.  It looks like I'll be taking Tech Transfer this summer, and Needs Assessment, Internetworking Lab, Imaging Science Lab (or something like that) and something about Haydn (to finish out my German concentration) in the fall.

I wouldn't have bothered to try and do it if it weren't going to save me something like $9,000.  I was planning on being here another year anyway, so I wasn't too anxious to get out of here early.  The only problem is that it leaves me with six free months before the 1-year MBA, if I decide to do it (it's only offered beginning in the summer).  I should be able to find a contract job or something for that, though.

I've been listening to Flogging Molly's newest album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002T7Z0M/qid=1114615358/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-5091157-9969413?v=glance&s=music&n=507846">Within A Mile of Home</a>, non-stop for like two weeks.  I was unimpressed with it the first time I heard it, but it grows on you damn quick.  Seeing it done live helps, too.
