FURTHERMORE (not that this "furthermore" follows anything, but it needed saying), Hollywood has run out of ideas.  While waiting for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/">Hitchhiker</a> to start, Heewa and I saw previews for the following:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0400497/">Herbie: Fully Loaded</a>, a Herbie re-make.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406375/">Zathura</a>, a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113497/">Jumanji</a> rip-off (from the writers of Jumanji!)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382628/">Dark Water</a>, a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298130/">Ring</a> rip-off (from the writer of The Ring!)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/">Star Wars: Episode III</a> (from the writer of Star Wars: The Rest of Them!)</li>
</ul>

I figure they completely ran out of ideas about two years ago.
