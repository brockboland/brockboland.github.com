First of all, I'm drunk, so please excuse typos.

The best evenings start with no plans at all.

Heewa and I decided to go see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>, which was better than expected.  They changed a lot from the book, but it was still pretty funny, and some scenes were just stunning.  And <a href="http://www.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0371724/Ss/0371724/HGC-04046R2.jpg?path=gallery&path_key=0371724">Marvin</a> wasn't at all how I pictured him (this seems to be the general consensus).

We stopped by the carnival for a bit, since it's Spring Fest weekend and all, but it was just plain disappointing.  Sharon called to say she was heading to A-Street with Jen and Kelly, and that's where the excitement began.

We started at Daisy Dukes, which was cool, but not quite what I expected.  Then we hit Bar Fly, which had decent music, but I'm no dancer.  Then we wandered down to A-Street Pub, which was awesome.  They played a lot of fun 80's tunes, I met all sorts of cool people (including the owner of The Roost), and the drinks were pretty cheap.  Some guy offered to lick Jen's back.  Schmitty, Lindsey, and Justin Ricci both showed up.  I had a number of drunken arguments with guys on the smoking patio.  A fella gave me a piece of gum on the way out.  It was a good place to be.

We went to Tahou's after.  I don't think I had been there since almost two years ago, when Resig was extra drunk and we told him to say terribly offensive things to the guy working the counter.

It was an outstanding evening.  I spent far more than I expected, but it was worth it.  I got to play body guard, and I love hanging out with those chicks.  I did the Marlboro survey again and got a free Zippo for Schmitty.  I had a real garbage plate for the first time in (I think) years.  And the bartenders made my Jack and Coke's with extra Jack when I asked.  Sometimes, Rochester is good to me.
