Since I know you're all concerned, I'm happy to announce that my iBook is OK after our <a href="/2006/04/aw-crap">little spill</a>.  I turned it on after leaving it open to dry out all day, and it got as far as the boot screen before an unpleasant clicking sound starting coming from it.  For you non-techies, unpleasant clicking sounds are almost never good.  I shut it off and gave it another day, and it was fine when I got home from work the next evening.  Good thing, too - a dead hard drive is about the last thing I want to deal with right now.

Also, the first season of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/index.html">Scrubs</a> will be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JNEQ/ref=pm_dp_ln_d_3/002-9511358-1138436?v=glance&s=dvd">out on DVD</a> next week.  I really hope that's not the final design for the cover; it reminds me of those crappy doctor game sets they sold when we were kids.  Monster Doctor comes to mind, but I can't find anything about it online so I'm not even sure that's what it was called.  I'll just assume you know what I'm talking about.
