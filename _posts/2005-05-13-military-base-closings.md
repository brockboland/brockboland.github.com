The front page article on CNN caught my eye this morning: The Pentagon <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/13/base.closings/index.html">recommended closing</a> some 30 military bases and a number of smaller facilities.  According to Rumsfield, this will save us $50 billion over two decades for the low price of 29,000 jobs.

Does anyone else see the fallacy in this?  Certainly, I'd love to see our military scale it back a bit.  But we're spending over $400 billion a year on defense, and that's not even counting the separate budget for Iraq.  I have to imagine we can cut $2.5 billion a year without having to send 29,000 people looking for new jobs.
