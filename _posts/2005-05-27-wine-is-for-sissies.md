<a href="http://www.jymferrier.net/">Jym</a> and I have been going back and forth over who's a bigger redneck.  My argument has always been that he's a candy ass because he <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/brocklisoup/495879.html">drinks wine</a>.

Well, after giving him plenty of shit, I figured I may as well try the stuff.  I've had a few wines, but nothing I've ever liked.  In last week's mad shuffle, two unopened bottles of wine made their way into our liquor shelf, so I thought they'd make a decent start.  One was a white zinfandel, which was OK, and the other a shiraz, which sucked.

Apparently two half-glasses of wine <a href="http://www.jymferrier.net/archives/2005/05/brock_is_busted.html">refutes my entire argument</a> against Jym, despite the fact that he's been on  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jymferrier/sets/294725/">A GODDAMN WINE TOUR</a>.

Candy ass.

At any rate, there's incriminating <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jymferrier/15930725/">evidence</a>.
