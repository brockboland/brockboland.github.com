<a href="http://www.jymferrier.net/">Jym</a> did a pretty good job of <a href="http://www.jymferrier.net/archives/2005/05/sometimes_fonny.html">recapping our evening</a> up in Toronto, so I won't bother doing it again.  Long and short of it is, it was fun to take a trip with the guys, and Toronto is a great city.

The only thing I'll add is that Fonny WAS right.  We were giving him shit a month or two ago, because he was going to a show at a skate park.  He tried to explain how incredible it was to be in the middle of a big group of people that were totally into the band, singing along to every verse and just being completely into it.  I finally got what he was talking about last night when Against Me! was on.  I enjoyed watching the crowd more than the band (at least partly because my <a href="/2005/05/illin">eyes are broke</a>, so I can't wear contacts, and I look absurd in glasses, so I wasn't wearing them, so I couldn't see the band anyway).  Everyone there was shouting along with the singer.  It made me wish I knew the songs better, because I felt like I was just standing on the outside of something really awesome.  During the last song, a dozen people <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/16125788/in/set-387129/">hopped on stage with them</a> and sang along (pic sucks, we were far back).  Before the show, some people up front started a sing-along.  On the way back to the hotel, the people behind us did the same.  It felt like no one there wanted to be anywhere else (except for Jym, once he found the pizza place across the street).  It was pretty incredible.

Anyway, it was a great start to what will surely be a great summer.  I'm looking forward to spending a quarter with these guys.
