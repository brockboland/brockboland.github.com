JymBob's XBox is set up with some kind of media center software that can connect to SAMBA shares on our machines and play MP3's or videos from them.

The first season of The Dukes of Hazzard came out on DVD a couple weeks ago, and a rip quickly found it's way online.

I can sit in my living room and watch the Dukes all damn day if I want to.  It's going to be a good summer.
