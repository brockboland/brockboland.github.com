Do book publishers send professors free books to entice them to use said books in their classes? Working in the College of Business, I've been noticing more and more that every professor's office has a few shelves full of books, and usually a few more stacks on the desk or floor.  There's no way these people are buying this many books for themselves, all on the same material. I just glanced around the office I'm in and counted 11 different Visual Basic .NET books.

I've often said that I'd like to become a professor because professors get offices with shelves and I need a place to keep my books. It didn't occur to me that I could get shelves AND books.
