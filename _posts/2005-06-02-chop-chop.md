I just went buck wild on my music collection and deleted about 3 of the 19.5 GB I had. I really just want to keep it under 18.5 so it all fits on the iPod, but once I got going I figured I may as well clean things out right. A decent chunk of my collection is comprised of music I've never heard, from compilations I've downloaded or bands that friends recommend. I was dropping 20 songs at a time from groups I'd only heard once or twice and didn't care for.

One of these days I'll go through it all and really clean house, but it's tough. There are a lot of older songs on there that I don't really care for, but remind me of high school or friends from home or things like that. I feel guilty deleting music that feels like part of my history, the same way I can't delete people from my buddy list even if I haven't seen or spoken to them in three years.
