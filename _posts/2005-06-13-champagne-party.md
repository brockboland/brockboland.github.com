Saturday night, we hosted Champagne Party Episode III: Revenge of the Swank, and it went off better than I could have hoped.  We were expecting somewhere around 50 people - it wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be, but I'd say at least 40 people were here throughout the course of the evening.  It was hard to gage because there was almost always a group of people outside smoking, getting fresh air, or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/19022244/in/set-447545/">peeing on BP's Jeep</a>.

We went through 36 bottles of the finest $4 champagne to be found, 90 cans of Miller High Life, and some liquor.  Sharon and I decided WAY too early in the evening to play <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/19017773/in/set-447545/">Edward Champagne Hands</a> (a variation of <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1724010">Edward Forty Hands</a>), although she only did one hand.  I drank way more than I should have (three bottles of champagne and at least 5 beers, by my count), but that only made things more interesting.  Jym tried to get me to fight him, leading to a bloody knee and smashed-up elbow (for the record, I had him on the ground and could have smashed his face in, but I'm not an asshole).  My <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/19021223/in/set-447545/">brother</a> came out for it, and I got some good shots of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/19018910/in/set-447545/">the roommates</a>.

It was an outstanding evening.  Kudos to BP for getting shit together and financing the operation.
