It's been one of those days all week.  We're upgrading every faculty and staff machine in the building, one way or another.  About 35 people are getting new machines, and another 50 machines will just be upgraded to Windows XP.  We started this process first thing Monday morning, so work has been a non-stop barrage of upgrading, installing, and backing-up for the past few days.

Even so, I'd take this over classes any day.  I spend more of my day at work than I do when I'm taking classes, and I'm beat every night when I get home, but the work is OK, the people are great, and I get a paycheck every two weeks that almost never fails to pay all the bills.

Life could be worse.
