It's been a busy week.  This past Thursday and Friday were spent in the chemistry lab, doing a quarter's worth of labs in two days.  Saturday morning, I went home for my cousins' 4th of July party that evening.  Yesterday was a BBQ at my aunt and uncle's house, then back to Rochester in the evening.  Today was supposed to be Gillian's BBQ, but I'm feeling more than a little run-down, so I'm going to stay home and be lame.

I'm really looking forward to finishing Chemistry.  I've spent so much time over the past four weeks watching those damn lectures and, more often, putting off watching those damn lectures.  It's a five-week course, so it'll be over next weekend, for better or worse.  Unfortunately, I still have to write up lab reports sometime in the next week and a half.

I can't wait for this crap to be over.  The second half of summer will be so much more relaxing without chem hanging over my head.  I've never dealt well with crappy classes - I always let them cause me too much stress, when I should really just get it over and done with and forget about it.  Either way, I'll be able to spend the rest of the summer getting a portfolio together so I can find a job sometime soon.

It's the fourth.  Relax, have a beer, and be thankful you've still got most of your freedoms.
