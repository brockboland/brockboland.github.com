A note to fundamentalists everywhere:

Blowing shit up will not gain sympathy for your cause.

I mean, come on guys.  Attacking your enemies - the people you're <i>actually fighting with</i> - is one thing.  But killing innocent people on public transportation isn't going to make you any friends.

Days like this remind me how great the Internet can be sometimes, in between the 14 year-olds trash talking each other and ridiculous Flash animation.  A <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/bomb/">group has already been started</a> on Flickr - right now, there are 279 members and 465 pictures.  Even on the other side of the pond, we can see what's happened far before the news can tell us, and offer our condolences to those directly affected.
