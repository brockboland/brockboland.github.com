It was an incredible weekend.  Rhubarb, Darrin, Shane and I drove out to the Adirondacks Friday night to spend the weekend at Potter's place on Brandreth Lake.  It was drizzly Friday and Saturday, but today was beautiful.  We just spent the weekend swimming in the lake, sitting in the hot tub, and hanging out around the house.  There was liquid nitrogen ice cream, kayaking, and butane rocket experiments (side note: this is probably why the first stop on Potter's tour of the place was the fire extinguisher).

Potter's brother owns 15 or 20 sets of paint ball equipment, so a bunch of us went and played today.  We went to a pretty big clearing in the woods, split into five-man teams, and played three rounds of capture the flag.  Potter didn't want to bring back any ammo, so we finished with a shootout at about 40 yards, which was WAY better than sneaking around in the woods with foggy goggles.  I had never played, so I'm really glad he had the equipment - left to my own devices, I probably wouldn't have tried it for a couple years.

Now that I'm back, I've got a ton of laundry to do and six more chem lab reports.  They're not due till midnight tomorrow, so I think I'm just going to do a couple more tonight and get some sleep.
