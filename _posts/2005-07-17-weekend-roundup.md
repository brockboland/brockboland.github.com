It's been a good week.  I spent Monday and Tuesday catching up on the sleep I missed <a href="/2005/07/brandreth">last weekend</a>.  Yesterday, I did the final test for Chem, so that's not hanging over my head any more.  We had a handful of people over last night for a shindig, which was a lot of fun.  Earlier this week, I bought a TiVo - I figure I'm going to have to get my own apartment soon enough, and that's one of the few appliances I want.  This guy here at RIT was selling it with the lifetime subscription (usually $299) for $175, so I couldn't pass it up.

Today, I've just been reading.  I feel like I should be working on something, but there's really nothing that needs doing.  I still want to do something with AJAX, and I've got a couple projects in various unfinished states, but I think I'd like to catch up on some reading before I jump back into programming.  I just haven't felt like doing it lately.  It's unfortunate, because I really should be polishing up some projects from the past few years and putting together a portfolio, but I just can't get into it.

Oh well.  I have lots to read and watch.  I can program later.
