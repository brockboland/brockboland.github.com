I don't know what I'm going to do with my life, or even what I'm doing next week, but I've got plans for next summer.

I intend to buy a bike and take a road trip up and down the east coast.  This map is my rough plan.

I'm shooting for late June.  Some people can take the summer off after college and travel Europe; I just want a week.

The more I think about it, the more I want to do it now.  I feel like I need to get out of here for a week and see old friends and new places.  If I could convince my dad to lend me his bike for a week and a half, I might try it at the end of this summer, but I doubt he'd be willing to do it.
