Two months to the day after starting, I've finally finished this book.  About a third of the way through, I put it down for a few weeks.  It started off strong and ended pretty strong, but the middle was just infuriating.  Frank spent way too much time doing exactly what he was criticizing: he kept insisting that conservatives make unfounded accusations against liberals, <i>but he didn't back it up</i>.  I was really getting into the first third of the book, but he lost me after a while.

I give it two stars out of five, where two stars is "only read it if you've got nothing else to do but shave the dog again."
