Next weekend is going to be pretty awesome.  On Thursday, we're going to see <a href="http://www.ticketweb.com/user/?region=ny&query=detail&event=614868">Flogging Molly</a> in Binghamton.  Friday (the 5th) is the opening of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377818/">Dukes</a> movie, and we'll be pre-gaming here before going to see it in full Dukes attire (10 points to anyone who paints their car orange for the occasion).  Saturday the 6th is the Redneck Party here, for which I'm importing a few REAL rednecks.

It'll be a rowdy good Irish redneck weekend.  Let me know if you're going to join us for any of it.
