Every few weeks, I find myself without plans for the weekend.  Once in a while, this is a welcome change: I can sit around and do nothing for a few days, catch up on sleep, do some reading, or catch a movie.  It almost never happens, though.  The weekends with no plans always turn out the busiest.

We saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356910/">Mr. & Mrs. Smith</a>, then had some people over for drinks.  Then we went mini-golfing, and had some people over for margarita night.  Then we saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436613/">Murderball</a> and had dinner at Stromboli Express, and I came home and had a drink and watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0176269/">Universal Soldier</a>, which was so bad it was great.

Weekends used to be for relaxing at the end of a rough week, but now I need Monday and Tuesday to recover from the weekend.
