Things have been going pretty well lately. Financially, I'm doing OK. I'm buying Becker's Saturn next week, and I've got plenty of money set aside to buy, insure, and register it. The Apple loan is paid off, so I can put a decent chunk of my last couple paychecks to the credit card bill.

I'm working on a new project at work for the big plasma screen in the college lobby. One of the secretaries in the Dean's office makes slides to show on it, but the system is pretty crappy, so we're re-writing it to just show a web site we're designing. I've been working on the client side, to make use of templates and styles that we'll define so she can build slides. It's been a lot of PHP and JavaScript, so I'm happy.

Classes are starting soon, which means people will be coming back from break in a week or two. I have never seen our parking lot so empty; apparently, most people go home for this break. It's the calm before the storm; RJ showed up yesterday, and I hear the RA's are starting to come back for their training.  Another week or two and everyone will be back.

I've gotten over the whole graduation thing. Usually, I only get stressed about money, when I realize I've got $1.64 in the bank and a $50 bill due in four days. I freak out for about 10 minutes before I convince myself that everything has worked out in the past, so it's sure to do so again. And it has - worrying about it has never fixed the problem, so I don't bother. My anxiety about leaving for the real world was a little more profound than that, but I'm over it. Things are going too well to worry much about what will happen a few months down the road.
