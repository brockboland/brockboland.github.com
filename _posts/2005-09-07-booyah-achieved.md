A spot opened up in both the Needs Assessment and Tech Transfer sections that I wanted to get into, so I did some switching around in my last class.  With those moved, I could switch into Hill's section of Networking, and I'm much happier with my <a href="http://schedule.csh.rit.edu/?s=QQG73WW">new schedule</a>.  I can't take racquetball with this one, but I'm not too broken up about it; I can still play whenever I want, and I was able to learn the real rules on the first day, so I'm happy.

My Thursday ends two hours earlier now, so my weekend starts early.  Granted, I'm working all day Saturday, but I really can't turn down eight hours at co-op pay.  I've got all day Friday and Sunday off, and I almost never get two full days - I usually wind up working either Saturday or Sunday.  This is deal-withable.
