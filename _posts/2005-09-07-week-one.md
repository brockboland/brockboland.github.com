This quarter's going to be unpleasant.  I really don't want to be taking any of the classes I'm in, but I don't have any options at this point.  Networking (4002-342) might be alright, but I haven't heard anything good about this prof.  Needs Assessment and Tech Transfer will both be easy, but a pain in the neck.  Hayden and Mozart is just going to be frustrating, because there's going to be a fair bit of reading that I don't want to do.  I want to rearrange things to get a different prof for Networking and make my Tuesday and Thursday end earlier, but two of the sections I would need to switch into are full right now.

I can't even procrastinate in front of the TV any more.  We had Sharon's for the summer, but BP and I took it back the other day.  I think BP is planning to buy a new one on payday.  Fonny <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/40982326/">drew us one</a> for the interim, but we can only watch The Dukes of Hazzard.

On the upside, I'm taking racquetball.  At the first class today, a number of rules were clarified; our version was pretty close to right, but with a few key differences regarding serves.

I should be OK this quarter, but I know it's going to drain me.  I've never been able to handle classes I don't want to take; last winter, when I was taking Genetic Algorithms and Artifical Intelligence, was absolutely miserable.  I know I'm just going to put off the stuff I don't want to do, and this time I don't even have a fun class that I can focus my energy on.  I shouldn't have saved all this crap for last.
