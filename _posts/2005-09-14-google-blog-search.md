Kick.  Ass.

<a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> may serve its purpose, but I'm thrilled about the new <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/">Google Blog Search</a>.  You can use the blogurl: option to specify a URL, which means you can easily search your blog or LiveJournal.  Every week or two, I go digging through LJ looking for a post I remember making a year and a half ago.    Unfortunately, it only goes back to June or so (according to the <a href="http://www.google.com/help/about_blogsearch.html#oldposts">FAQ</a>) but they're working on that.  I imagine this will come in real handy.
