As <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/brocklisoup/503225.html">noted</a>, I need a whiteboard in the shower.

Over the course of 20 years or so, one finds oneself with a showering routine.  I don't have to think about what I'm doing in there - it's deeply ingrained habit.  This allows my mind to wander, and I often have some of my best ideas in there.  I decided to invent a shower whiteboard so I can write stuff down when it occurs to me.  To the right, you can see my prototype (patent pending, you bastards), and the first batch should go to production this week.

I figure, it'll do better than those shower radios, because that's just a bad place to dance.
