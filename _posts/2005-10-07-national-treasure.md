<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368891/">National Treasure</a>, starring <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/">Nicolas Cage</a> as Nicolas Cage, is perfect for a Friday night.  I've always had a soft spot for mindless action movies - especially ones that cash in on the popularity of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385504209/">The Da Vinci Code</a> - and this was one of my favorites yet.  They had me 15 minutes in, with an (accidental?) Weird Al reference when they were trying to solve a riddle.

"Prison."
"Albuquerque. See, I can do it too. Snorkel."
