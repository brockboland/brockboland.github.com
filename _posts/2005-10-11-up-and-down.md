It's been a weird couple of weeks.  I got back two of the three midterms I took, and did alright.  I was hoping to do better, but at this point, I just want to finish what needs doin' and get out of here.

Some things haven't turned out as I'd hoped they would, but do they ever?

I've been drifting listlessly through this quarter.  I'm taking a bunch of crap classes that I put off for years.  Work is going well, in the sense that nothing bad has happened, but it's not terribly stimulating either.  I haven't been too excited or upset about anything in weeks...just generally disinterested.

Part of it is the fact that I'm leaving soon, I know that.  Yesterday, I was walking down the sidewalk and realized how I don't even think about the campus anymore; five years ago, I loved wandering around during the visits I made before I started freshman year.  It struck me that in four years, I've probably spent 95% of my time on this chunk of land - everything is on campus.  Class, work, food, my apartment - most of my friends live here too.  Even now that I've got a car, I don't have any reason to leave campus most days.  Just as it was a big change to move here, it's going to be a big change leaving again.
