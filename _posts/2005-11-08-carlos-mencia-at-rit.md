I just got the weekly events e-mail that RIT sends out.  No one seems to read these things - everyone is always so surprised to find out when cool stuff is going on around here - but I usually glance through it and see if anything exciting is happening.  Any time a big show is booked, they start including it way ahead of time, especially if tickets will be going on sale soon.  This one had a note about Carlos Mencia.  He'll be here in January, and tickets go on sale in a couple weeks.

A couple months ago, I would have been thrilled to see that there.  His Comedy Central Presents show was fantastic.  He spits in the face of political correctness, which needs to be done now and then.  It was just raunchy enough with just enough political motivation to make it interesting.

But, like I said, I would have been excited about this a couple months ago.  He's since got his own show on Comedy Central, <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/mind_of_mencia/index.jhtml">Mind of Mencia</a>.  I've only seen two or three episodes, but really, that's all you need because it's all the same.  Some of the bits are "can they do that on TV?" hilarious, but a lot of it's just infantile and repetitive.  I really don't think he's going to have any new material when he's here, and even if he does, it's going to be another take on the same issues.

Of course, I had low expectations for <a href="/2005/01/somebody-shit-coats">Dane Cook</a> when he came and was pleasantly surprised, so maybe Carlos will pull through.
