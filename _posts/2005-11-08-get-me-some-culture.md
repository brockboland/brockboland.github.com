I spent the evening at another classical concert than was almost exciting as the <a href="/2005/10/show-roundup#RPO">first</a>, but this time, it was chamber music.  The first piece was by Beethoven, which was alright.  The last was a Dvorak, which was OK.

But the second piece, Bergâ€™s Lyrische Suite, made me want to cry a little bit.  It was six movements of dissonant, pretentious, classical fan-boy snobbery.  Really, I think the only people that like this guy are looking for classical indie cred.  It was a creepy, dark piece, and while some parts sounded kind of cool, there was no musical theme or any kind of consistent idea or anything; normally, that would be fine, but not so much when you're supposed to write a paper about the music.  I thought it would be more fun if I imagined the musicians as clowns, but that just made it scary.

The show was at the <a href="http://www.esm.rochester.edu/">Eastman School of Music</a>, and since Darrin was on-campus at the time, we drove out there together.  I wound up sitting next to a girl who's a freshman here at RIT.  She asked for a ride home, which seemed a little odd, but I'm the adventurous type!  So we had merry adventures finding our way home, because I've never taken the same way home from downtown twice (mostly because I don't actually know the way home and wing it every time).

In conclusion: I need to spend more time downtown, and I think I might like a sandwhich.
