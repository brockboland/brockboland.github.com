I've been cutting my own hair with clippers for four or five years now.  I have this curly, puffy mess on my head, so there's not much else I can do with it.  I've owned a few different clippers over the years, some better than others, but they've always got the job done - a quarter inch, all the way 'round.

Last night, the inevitable happened - my clippers died mid-clip.  I had cut the first few inches of the front when they stopped cutting and started combing.  They've had problems in the past - hair gets in there and jams them up.  I thought ahead this time, though, and cleaned them out beforehand.  Maybe I shouldn't have used DW-40 to oil up the metal parts, but that's neither here nor there.

Now, this isn't the first time this has happened.  Last summer, <a href="http://www.ryandoherty.net/">Ryan</a> came over to use my previous set of clippers and got himself a half-cut.  Lucky for him, Rhubarb was home, so he just drove across campus and finished the job there.

I knew I needed to replace them again, so I didn't bother looking for a pair to borrow.  As much as I hate WalMart, it was the only place open at that time on a Friday night, so I pulled on a hat and went shopping.  The ones I picked out are like industrial strength sheet metal cutters.  They had no problem plowing through my hair and it was the quickest cut I've ever done.

In retrospect, I should have bought two of them so I don't find myself in the same situation when this one dies.
