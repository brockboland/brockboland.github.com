I have never bombed a test quite so spectacularly as the Needs Assessment final I just took.  Somehow, he managed to avoid all the material that I'd studied the most.  I'm pretty sure the answer to number six wasn't "In retrospect, I shouldn't have re-read this article while watching football, but at least Dallas won."

I was hoping to hang onto that 3.4, but I think that between this and Haydn and Mozart, I'm out of luck.

In spite of my discontent with the test, I can't help but feel relieved.  Just two more finals and I'm out of here.
