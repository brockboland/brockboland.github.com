I've always been a fast test-taker, so it's rare that I'm not one of the first people done with any test or final.  It's partly because I like to see how fast I can do it, and party because they're not terribly exciting and I just want to get them over with.  Most of the time, you can leave once you're done, so that's always been an incentive.

Today was just a joke, though.  A 35 question Tech Transfer final, and I finished in 18 minutes.  I don't know why I bothered getting up at 7 for that.

Part of me wants to just get my day started; I've got a lot of stuff to do before I leave for <a href="/2005/11/best-weekend-history-road-trips">the weekend</a>, but I think I need to catch up on a few hours of sleep or I'll never make it to Tuesday.

On a related note, I've already got three of my grades.  I was expecting the C in Haydn and Mozart - Classical music just isn't something I'll ever get.  I was surprised to find I got an A in Networking, since I remember most of my grades being in the 80's.  And finally, a B in Needs Assessment, despite <a href="/2005/11/crash-and-burn">blowing it on the final</a> - I really should have <a href="/2005/07/screw-you-science">learned my lesson</a> sooner.

I've got a lot more to say about this whole graduating business - stay tuned.
