In five days, I've gotten way too little sleep, spanned four states, and put over 1000 miles on Malique (by the way, I named my car Malique).  I've spent hours lost in a city I've never seen and spent way too much on coffee.  I've lived out of a car, which currently looks like a gang of four year-olds have made it their secret fort.  I've resisted the urge to have a cigarette, despite the fact that I drove for a good 20 hours and spent time around a campfire.

Oh, and I'm moving to the DC area in four days.  Details to follow, but I suddenly find myself with no boxes and about fourteen hours to pack my worldly possessions.
