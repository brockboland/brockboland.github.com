Dear Internet,

Today I decided to make chicken salad for lunch.  I learned the following lessons:
<ol><li>Less egg.</li>
<li>More mayo.</li>
<li>Chop the chicken smaller.</li>
<li>Chicken salad tastes better cold.</li>
<li>Sourdough was obviously the best choice for that sandwich.</li></ol>
In the process, I had to learn how to hard-boil an egg, which was touch and go for a little while there, but it all worked out.
