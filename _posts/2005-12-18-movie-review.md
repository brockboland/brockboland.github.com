I've been watching a lot of movies in my newfound free time.  It's been nearly three weeks since I moved down here, and I've seen 14 films since then.  I want to get my money's worth from <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, Mondays is dollar night at <a href="http://www.arlingtondrafthouse.com/">the Drafthouse</a>, and we've made a few visits to Regal.  I've got a list of hundreds of movies I need to see, and at this rate, it almost seems like a plausible goal.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115734/">Bottle Rocket</a>
I didn't really like it when I saw it a couple years ago, but I figured it deserved a second chance.  It didn't.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402022/">AEon Flux</a>
Badass.  I never saw the cartoon and didn't know the back story, so I couldn't be offended when it strayed from the original.  The pacing was weird in the first 20 minutes or so, but it got interesting quick and I liked the plot.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/">Serenity</a>
Way badass.  Again, never saw Firefly, so I couldn't be too disappointed.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064276/">Easy Rider</a>
Disappointment.  I was expecting a biker movie, not an artsy-political-statement hippie flick.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>
Pretty good.  Thanks to a mistake on the Circuit City site, and Matt pointing it out to me, I got the box set real cheap.  I'll probably watch the other two this week.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396269/">Wedding Crashers</a>
I'm not sure what I was expecting, but that wasn't quite it.  Still, it was hilarious.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063462/">The Producers (1968)</a>
Gene Wilder irritates me, and I've never cared for older movies - they sound funny.  For all the pissing and moaning about the re-make, I think I'm going to like it more than the original.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365737/">Syriana</a>
Disappointment.  Marketed as an action movie, but it's a political flick.  Probably would have liked it more if I was expecting that, but I wanted explosions.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405422/">The 40 Year Old Virgin</a>
Way better than expected.
