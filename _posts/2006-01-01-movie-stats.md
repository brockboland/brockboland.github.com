<p>Two years ago this month, I started tracking every movie I saw.  I got the idea when <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/grahams/">Grahams</a> posted a list of the movies he'd seen in 2003.  I only note movies I see all the way through; if I catch the second half a movie on TV, it doesn't count.  In 2004, I saw 120 different movies (seven of them twice, and Boondock Saints three times).  In 2005, I saw 87 different movies (six of them twice).</p>

<p>Other numbers for 2005 (because I'm fond of numbers):</p>

<p>I kind of feel guilty for not going to The Little more than I did.  I saw sixteen movies there in 2004 (though even that sounds low, with the times we saw two or three in a day).  I'm not surprised that the ratings are skewed the way they are; I do a pretty good job of avoiding movies I won't like, but I'm trying to be harsher in my judgment to even out the average a little better.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to see more in 2006.  There are tons of movies I've been meaning to see that I just haven't had time for yet.  I've got 272 discs in my Netflix queue right now, and even without the TV series, that's a lot of movies to keep me busy.</p>
