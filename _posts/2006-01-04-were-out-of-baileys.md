Dear Google,

Where's the nearest liquor store?  On <a href="http://www.google.com/local?num=20&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=liquor&near=Arlington,+VA+22206&ll=38.845357,-77.068233&spn=0.021492,0.040255">Glebe</a>, you say?  Gee whiz, that's within <a href="http://www.google.com/local?f=li&daddr=2955+S+Glebe+Rd,+Alexandria,+VA+22301&saddr=1400+28th+st+s,+Arlington,+VA+22206">stumbling distance</a>!  I won't even have to go looking for it before the weekend hits!

Thanks Google!

Heart,
Brock
