Reassuringly, my car passed a safety inspection.  Not so reassuringly, it failed the emissions test, but the guy was revving it up something fierce - a Lexus would smoke if you whomped on it like that.  So, I can't register it in Virginia unless I have it repaired (which may involve a new EGR or catalytic converter), which isn't something I can do right now.  I only paid $500 for the damn thing in the first place, so it doesn't make sense to pour a few hundred more in every few months.  I'm starting to think I could get away with replacing the car with a motorcycle, but I have no moneys.  I want to find a newer, bigger car, but that will cost even more.

As such, I'm going to my Contingency Plan, which depends on a Lottery win.  I tried to buy a Lottery ticket today, but the gas station that does car inspections doesn't sell Lottery tickets.

I had Contingency Plan B, but I forgot what it was.  I'm pretty sure it involved more work, so that leads us to Contingency Plan C, wherein you all send me a dollar.  You overachievers can send several dollars if you'd like - in fact, it's encouraged! - but you don't have to if you'd rather not.

Worst case scenario, I have to take the bus in to work.  So, let's all pull together, folks - I don't like mingling with the commoners.
