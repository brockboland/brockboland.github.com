I was checking the <a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/">Virginia DMV</a> site to see if they would be open tomorrow.
<blockquote>All DMV offices will be closed on Friday, January 13, 2006, and on Monday, January 16, 2006, in observance of Lee-Jackson Day and Martin Luther King, Jr., Day.</blockquote>
