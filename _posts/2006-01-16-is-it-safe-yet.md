I could have sworn that I wrote about this a month ago, but my <a href="/2005/12/2005-i-hardly-knew-ye">year-end roundup</a> is the only reference I can find.  I have yet to touch a cigarette since quitting in <a href="/2005/10/kick-it">early October</a>.  Things went surprisingly well for the first few weeks.  I was expecting to crack during one of the drives between Virginia and New York - driving is always the toughest - but I've made it three and a half months.  I certainly didn't think I could make it this far, and I don't think any of my detractors did either.  I'm pretty sure this is the longest I've gone without a smoke since I was 17.

I can't say that I miss it terribly.  I almost never wake up coughing, unless it's been a particularly cold night (I tend to leave the heat low).  I'm sure that I've saved a fair bit of money, though I don't feel like calculating the specifics now.

Even so, I find myself pining for a smoke now more than ever.  It gave me something to do.  When I was nervous, I'd smoke.  It was a life saver in crowded bars where I didn't know many people.  It gave me a chance to organize my thoughts when I was stumped with a problem.  It provided some measure of social outlet; non-smokers don't believe me when I tell them how many people I met because of it.

And finally, I've been watching a lot of movies lately.  Every time a character takes a drag, I wish I could do the same.  I remember watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202677/">The Way of The Gun</a> at Shaun J's about a year and a half ago.  Every time the characters pulled out a smoke, we'd pause the movie and climb out the window onto the fire escape to enjoy one ourselves.  Another time, in Dan and Rhubarb's room, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144117/">Boondock Saint's</a> took us about three hours to finish because of all the smoke breaks (granted, we were drinking too, so there were a lot of piss breaks).

I keep wondering if it's safe to have the occasional smoke yet.  I know, at the back of my mind, that the first one will be the end of me, but I try to convince myself that I can have one now and then without getting started again.

I've done well so far.  I have no intention of buying a pack, but I really didn't think it would get harder along the way.
