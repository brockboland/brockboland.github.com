In the fifth or sixth grade, my science teacher asked the class, "What do you know about the word 'frequency'?"

"There's an R.E.M. song called 'What's the Frequency Kenneth?', I think," said I.

At the time, I didn't R.E.M. was cool, so I was embarrassed to say it.  I knew the song from Monster, but only because of my cousin's seemingly eclectic musical preference.  But man, at that time, R.E.M. represented everything I wish I was.
