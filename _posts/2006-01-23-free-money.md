When I was trying to find a place in Arlington, I checked <a href="http://www.rent.com/">Rent.com</a>, because that seemed like a reasonable place to start looking.  They have floor plans and photos for a lot of apartment buildings and developments, so you can get a a decent feel for the place before you drive out there to see it.

More importantly, they offered a $100 reward if you find a place through them.  And since I did, a Visa debit card showed up in the mail today.

I can think of all sorts of fun things to spend $100 on, but I think I'm going to do the responsible thing and toss it in my glove box for gas money.  On the other hand, if my car gets stolen, it will be the most valuable thing they walk away with, so maybe I'll just spend it on hookers and blow.
