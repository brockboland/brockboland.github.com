Way back on Friday, Casey, Schmitty and I drove up to RIT for F-ed Up Movie Night (censored for the easily offended) (that's you, Mom).  They say the trip is half the fun, but they're pretty much always wrong.  Once in a while, though, I get to take a long drive with people I really enjoy, so this was a good trip.

The weekend was good - not great, but good.  I got to see a bunch of people I missed, but I also had to see a handful of people I had no interest in seeing ever again.  I suppose that'll happen, though.  I never made it to Mark's for a plate, but I did get to do Dibella's and Dinosaur BBQ, so it worked out OK.  The movie night featured a pretty good lineup - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049518/">The Silent World</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094075/">Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365125/">A Dirty Shame</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310775/">Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance</a> - and ended quite a bit earlier than usual (a welcome change, with the 8-hour drive home the next morning).

I did a lot of thinking and soul-searching over the course of the weekend.  Arriving back in Rochester wasn't the homecoming I thought it would be.  I realized that what I really miss is the Rochester of two or three years ago, before friends started graduating and leaving town.  There are still a good number of friends there, but there are also a lot of new folks that I don't know well, and the whole dynamic has changed.  It's actually sort of a relief, because I don't feel like I'm missing much by being a few states away.

I also decided that I'm not as happy here in VA as I thought I was and have been claiming to be.  I spent four years living with close friends, and it's been tough adjusting to my own place.  I've got several friends in the area, but they're spread out enough that I don't get to see much of them.

I don't know who Casey was quoting when she said, "Don't expect to find it here if you don't bring it yourself," and I couldn't say it better.  I certainly can't blame anyone else for the fact that I spend so many of my evenings hanging out at home.  We've been seeing movies at <a href="http://www.arlingtondrafthouse.com/">The Drafthouse</a> almost every Monday, and doing dinner once in a while, and I always have a great time.  I want to see if we can't start doing coffee or something the same time every week, further north in DC or out west towards Tyson's Corner, so that more people will be close enough to join us.  I definitely want to see the sights and museums in the District, and I'm entertaining the idea of starting a local chapter of the <a href="http://www.sundaynightfilmclub.com/">Sunday Night Film Club</a>.  I'm happy when I'm with people, so I need to take the initiative and get them together.

There's a lot to do in this city, and there's no reason for me to be sitting around being bored.  I'm not sure yet that I made the right choice in coming to DC, but I do know I made the right choice in leaving Rochester.  Sooner or later, this will feel like home.

Oh, and the birthday bit - I started this blog a year ago today, under my account on the CSH server (actually, the "<a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~brock/">We done moved</a>" page is still up).  I never got around to re-doing the design, or writing all the things that I meant to, so maybe those will be some last-minute New Year's resolutions.
