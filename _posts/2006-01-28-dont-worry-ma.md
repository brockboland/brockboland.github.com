Preface: Earlier today I talked to my mom, and I told her I was spending the afternoon geeking out.  She called back this evening to ask me about something else (it's also worth noting that I'm the only one of her kids with curly hair).

Mom: You still geeking out?
Me: Yeah, I've been sitting in front of the TV working on my laptop for a couple hours.
Mom: I hope it's not on your lap!
Me: Don't worry Mom, it's not on my crotch.
Mom: Good, because I want curly haired grandkids someday.

A couple months ago, she called to warn me not to set my laptop on my lap because she saw an article about it killing sperm.
