You would think that writing a plugin for <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/">Movable Type</a> would be pretty easy, especially if you've read that it is, in fact, pretty easy.

You would be wrong.

Based on what I've seen, writing a plugin for Movable Type is a colossal pain in the ass.  I don't even want to do anything complex - I just want to manage a list of movies I've seen recently, and display the last five in the sidebar.  Previously, I posted an entry into a Recently Viewed category (which you can see <a href="/archives/recently_viewed/">here</a>) that wasn't displayed on the main or archive pages.  The most recent five posts were put in the side bar, and linked to IMDB (through another hack - the Excerpt on every entry was just the URL for the movie's page).

After spending a couple hours this afternoon reading information about plugins and trying to make sense of it, I've lost interest in finishing the site today.  I DID get it upgraded to MT 3.2, which is a start, and means that you folks using news readers will probably be flooded (especially on <a href="http://syndicated.livejournal.com/brock_blog/">LJ</a>).  Sooner or later, I'll reign in my ridiculous category list, restore my portfolio and about page, and come up with a new design (which, you may recall, was the original goal for the day).

And dammit, writing a plugin can't be THAT hard, right?  I'll probably take another crack at it soon, because it's really irritating me that I had no luck with it today.
