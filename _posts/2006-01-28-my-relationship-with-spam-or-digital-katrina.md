I decided that it's finally time to re-design and upgrade this site (like I was going to <a href="/2005/10/doh">over three months ago</a>), and I wasn't going to say anything about it until I finished, but I need to mention this.  In backing up everything, I found myself with a 24 MB SQL file.  Now, the only tables in there are for Movable Type, and I've only got a couple hundred posts on this site, so I was surprised to see that it took up so much space.

Until I took a gander at the file, that is.  Most of the lines started with "SpamLookup",  Sure enough, I can't even open the Activity Log, and the mt_log table has over 75,000 rows.  I can't imagine what would have happened without SpamLookup.  MT 3.2 is supposed to have decent spam prevention, so hopefully it won't be much of a problem once I upgrade.

In a similar vein, the Spam in GMail is reaching impressive levels.  For a long time, I emptied the Spam folder every few days.  After a while I was nuking a dozen pages every day, so I just gave up.  Messages in there are deleted after 30 days, but I've still got 8984 in there.  A couple dozen still make it to my Inbox every day, but that's a lot better than it could be.
