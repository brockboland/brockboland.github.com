<p>Allow me to summarize the State of the Union address for you</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People want to kill you.  Weapons of mass murder AND destruction.  For reals.
</p><p>
Iraq is in great shape - they even voted not too long ago.  We fight for freedom (unless it's here, in which case you might be a terrorist).  If we leave now, we're cowards.  You're not a coward, are you?
</p><p>
Hey look, I brought along the family of a dead soldier.  I'm a good guy, right?
</p><p>
They'll kill you!  THEY'LL KILL US ALL!!
</p><p>
I can order surveillance on you, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it (thunderous applause, cut to Hillary Clinton with stupid expression).
</p><p>
Nine eleven Iraq freedom liberty Al Queda Patriot Act terrorists Iran nukyular God Homeland Security terrorist Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I only watched 20 minutes before I lost interest, but I think we all know how it ends.  God Bless America.</p>
