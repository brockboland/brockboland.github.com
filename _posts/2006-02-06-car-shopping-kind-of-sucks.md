I need a new car.  <a href="/2005/11/go-south-young-man">Malique</a> has been dying a slow death, and I knew it was over when she failed the emissions test.  Since I have no money, buying a used car from a private seller is pretty much out of the question.  I found a few cheap cars at dealers, but most seem unwilling to finance a $3000 car.  As much as it pains me, I've started looking in the $5 - 6K range, where the rides are a little smoother and the checkbook a little tighter.  As long as I can get monthly payments at or below $250, I think I can swing it.  I'll probably be paying for the damn thing for years to come, but at least I'll get where I'm going.

Right now, I'm looking at mid-sized sedans (Civic, Focus, Camry - that sort of thing) and smaller pickups (S-10, Ranger).  I've heard good things about <a href="http://www.carmax.com/">Carmax</a>, but they seem to be on the pricey side (though the payment calculator certainly helped give me some perspective).  I've had better luck on <a href="http://www.autotrader.com/">AutoTrader</a>, but they're search results aren't as compact as they could be - there's a lot to sift through to find the good stuff.

My plan is to have this all sorted out by the end of the month.  Remind me to pick up a lottery ticket.
