I was drunk when I booked a flight home for Christmas (it seems to me like there should be federal regulations against that), so when Travelocity offered to sign me up for a trial with a couple different services, I was an easy sell.

Today I found out that I was charged $15 each for the both of them, and probably was in January, too.

Computers should come equipped with breathalysers.
