I had heard mixed reviews about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421054">Domino</a>, and I can't say I can do any better.  I really wanted to like this movie - I mean, damn, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0461136/">Kiera Knightley</a> with guns!  The trailer was sort of misleading, though: she wasn't shooting people nearly enough, and half of the movie was done in that style (which got old REAL quick).  And what the hell was that thing with Tom Waits?  The action movie suddenly turns into a Jesus movie.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_harvey">Domino's</a> story is an interesting one, but I don't feel it was told well.  Seeing a crappy movie is one thing, but seeing a crappy movie that should have been good is just a disappointment, even is Kiera WAS prancing around with a shotgun.
