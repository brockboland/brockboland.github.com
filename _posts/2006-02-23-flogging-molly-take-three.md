Last night, I had the pleasure of seeing <a href="http://www.floggingmolly.com/">Flogging Molly</a> in concert for the third time in a year.  The show was over at <a href="http://www.930.com">9:30</a>, and I went with Bryan and Jeff from work, and Bryan's fianc√© Katie.

I can't lie - it wasn't as good as the <a href="/2005/04/most-tiring-week-ever">first</a> <a href="/2005/08/flogging-molly-round-two">two</a> times I saw them.  I wasn't really expecting it to be, though; I knew that seeing them without BP and Sharon just wouldn't be the same.  It was a 21+ show, so the folks in the pit were bigger and capable of doing a lot more damage.

<a href="http://www.rollingblackouts.com/">The Rolling Blackouts</a> opened the show with a lackluster set.  They were fun to watch, but not very good.  <a href="http://www.scotchgreens.com/">Scotch Greens</a> were a lot better - sort of a blue-grassy punk sound - but they played a full-length set, and must have been up there for an hour, so Flogging didn't even go on until like 10:30.  I wound up leaving before the show was even over: I went to take a leak, and decided I had been hit in the chest enough times for one evening.  And, the last train was only 15 minutes away, so it was that or $20 for a cab ride home.

Flogging's set was as good as always, but it took the sound guy three or four songs to figure out what he was doing - the backup mics weren't even on for the first song.  They didn't play Within A Mile of Home before I left, which was disappointing.  The Guinness was $6 a can, which almost makes Rochester look good (which reminds me, I met three different people from Rochester before the show).

So yeah, it could have been better.  I blame Scotch Greens for the fact that I couldn't see the whole show, but what can ya do?  <a href="http://www.againstme.net/">Against Me!</a> will be here in April, and my hopes are higher for that one.
