I'm trying to find a decent media collection manager.  <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> is pretty nice, but the interface is a little bit clunky and I'm not sure it's worth $40.  I like the fact that it can read barcodes, but that would require a $120 dollar iSight (or that new iMac I've been pining for).

I'd prefer something web-based, so I can use it from anywhere - Delicious Library is nice, but I could only use it on my laptop.  I tried <a href="http://www.listal.com/">Listal</a>, but it doesn't have some of the functionality of Delicious, like format (paperback, hardcover).

Really, <a href="http://www.intervocative.com/DVDCollection.aspx/brockli">DVD Profiler</a> is perfect, except for the fact that it doesn't handle books.  Has anyone else found something better?
