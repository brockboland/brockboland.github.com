Dear <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/26/anagram_transit_maps.html">Boing Boing</a> and <a href="http://www.dcist.com/archives/2006/02/27/your_monday_met.php">everyone else</a>:

For the love of Bob, no one cares anymore.  Calling it a "transit mashup" doesn't make it any more interesting.  The horse has been killed, kicked, buried, excavated, buried again, and raped enough for the week, don't you think?
