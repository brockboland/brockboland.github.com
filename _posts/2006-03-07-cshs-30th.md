This weekend was <a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu">CSH</a>'s 30th Anniversary, so Dan, Rhubarb, Oompa and I drove up for a few days.  As I'd hoped, it turned out way better than my <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2006/01/rock_star_road_trip_and_a_birt.php">last trip north</a>.  The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109440395/in/set-72057594077356710/">ride up</a> was a blast.  BP threw a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109440621/in/set-72057594077356710/">Friday</a>-<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109441190/in/set-72057594077356710/">night</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109441278/in/set-72057594077356710/">party</a> again, which was fantastic.  I spent most of Saturday fighting a hangover, until the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109441680/in/set-72057594077356710/">banquet</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109441829/in/set-72057594077356710/">at 6</a>.  The dinner was way better than any of us thought RIT capable, and we all <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109441625/in/set-72057594077356710/">danced</a> for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109441653/in/set-72057594077356710/">hours</a> (or <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109441774/in/set-72057594077356710/">stripped</a>).  We did a lunch Sunday <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109441852/in/set-72057594077356710/">afternoon</a> in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109441905/in/set-72057594077356710/">GCCIS</a>, then <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109441926/in/set-72057594077356710/">hung out</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109441992/in/set-72057594077356710/">on floor</a> for a couple hours.  My parents came out from Buffalo so we could do dinner (I finally took them to Mark's), and then I just hung out with BP (and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109442201/in/set-72057594077356710/">made pizza</a>) until leaving Monday morning.  The trip back was as uneventful as the ride up, and we stopped at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/109442495/in/set-72057594077356710/">Skeeters</a> for lunch.

I don't think I could have asked for a better weekend.  I got to see all the people that didn't make it up last time, met some alumni, and just spent the weekend relaxing and reminiscing with people I like.  It's nice to re-tell our stories and remember the good times; when you've only got a few days, it's easy to forget the unpleasant aspects of day-to-day college life: the classes, the inevitable drama bred by close quarters, the abject poverty.  It's unfortunate that I can't see these people more often, but it makes these weekends all the better.

Of course, the Monday after is always tough, but what can ya do?

You can look <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/72057594077356710/">at photos</a>, that's what.
