I know people who swear by NyQuil, but it's never done much for me.  This week, I found something way better - Chloraseptic throat spray.  I picked it up a couple weeks ago when I had a sore throat, but I was better by the time I got home so I didn't try it until a few days ago.  Within a minute or two , it completely numbs whatever you spray it on - you just get a bit of a tingling sensation.  My throat was destroyed by a weekend of yelling, drinking, smoking, and cold, dry, Rochester air, and this stuff has been a godsend.
