Like most lazy Sunday afternoons, I was lying around, reading a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=ws%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0060529709%2526tag=ws%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0060529709%25253FSubscriptionId=0782RYY3QEFRPDXVN402">book</a>, when I heard sirens nearby.  I stepped outside just as an ambulance and fire truck pulled up in front of my building, followed by four more trucks.  I thought my afternoon was about to get more interesting, but they started rolling the hoses back up just a couple minutes later.  Like a good blogger, I snapped a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/72057594080623879/">few pictures</a> before they took off.

And, in related news, I finally got renter's insurance last week.
