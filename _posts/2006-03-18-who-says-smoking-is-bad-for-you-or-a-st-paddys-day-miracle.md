Before I start this story, I need to admit that I've started smoking again, part time.  I'm not a smoker; I'm a tobacco hobbyist.

This evening, I took a cab home from the Metro stop after <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/72057594084565315/">St. Patrick's Day celebrations</a> (which I'll get to in a moment), and, as I have a few nights this past week, I pulled my folding chair outside to enjoy a smoke and a glass of water before going to bed.

As I was sitting there, I noticed that the mulch around the tree right by my front door was wet.  "Some bastard peed on my tree!" I thought.  And it's probably best that I noticed: a moment later, I saw some smoke rising from the mulch that hadn't been pissed on.  It looked like someone had tossed their cigarette in there before I got home, so I stepped on it to put it out, but it kept smoking.  Even after pouring the rest of my water on it, it was sizzling and smoldering, so I went inside to get more water to make sure it was out.

So there.  If I hadn't been smoking, my tree may well have caught fire.  Now, I DID <a href="/archives/2006/03/fire_trucks.php">get renter's insurance</a> not too long ago, but I still don't want to deal with that.  My filthy habit may have saved the day.

At any rate, it was a weird St. Paddy's Day.  I did dinner at the <a href="http://capcitybrew.com/">Cap City Brewery</a>, then most of us headed into DuPont to hit <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&id=792591">Lucky Bar</a> and catch up with my buddy Jeff.  Despite the pub decor, it was mostly yuppies and hipsters dancing to hip-hop.  I would have preferred a nice pub with actual Irish music, but we had a good time nonetheless.

Every time I hang out in the District, I want to move there more.
