I've never read the book, so I had no idea what to expect when I went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363771/">The Chronicles of Narnia</a> last night with Schmitty.  Unlike <a href="/2006/03/v-vendetta">V</a>, I <em>totally</em> got this one - Aslan is supposed to be Jesus!  I mean, he died for the sins of the Son of Adam, the thing broke and he came back from the dead, and then he bit off that lady's face.

Just like Jesus.
