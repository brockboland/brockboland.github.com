It was months ago when I <a href="/2005/09/eugene-hutz">saw the preview</a> for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0404030">Everything is Illuminated</a>.  I'm assuming the book was doing OK by then, but I hadn't heard about it.  The only reason I even remembered the trailer was because of Eugene Hutz.  I figured I should read the book before seeing it, so I picked it up a couple weeks ago and finished it last weekend.  The beginning is a little hard to follow, but it was an interesting read.

The movie was pretty good, but I don't know if I like the changes they made.  Obviously, they could really only do half the story: Johnathan's trip through Ukraine.  The grandfather's modified back story was a bit of a surprise.  There was some other crap, but Scrubs is on so I'm a bit distracted.

Hutz was surprisingly good, but it was weird to see him without the crazy mustache, and with a shirt on - he's very much like Dan Lee that way.
