If you want to survive the next zombie outbreak, you should consider grabbing a copy of this book.  I picked it up because I thought it would be funny, but it turned out to be pretty interesting.  It's written with a "this is going to happen, prepare yourself" kind of attitude, and really gets into the best ways to handle, you know, a zombie uprising.  I especially liked the Recorded Attacks section, detailing zombie outbreaks all the way up to 2002.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to pick up some canned goods and a machete.
