For those of you who were interested, I posted my <a href="/projects/itunes-pl-hack/">quick and dirty hack</a> to fix my <a href="/2006/04/aw-crap">iTunes playlist woes</a>.  It won't re-create the playlists, but I got the information I wanted.

And yes, I know it can be done in a few lines of Perl, but I know PHP much better than Perl, so this was the quickest (and easiest) way for me to do it.
