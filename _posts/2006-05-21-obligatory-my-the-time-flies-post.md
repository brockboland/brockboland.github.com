I've been in Virginia for just a week shy of six months.  It certainly doesn't seem like it's been that long, but at the same time, it feels like a lifetime since I left RIT.  DC has been good to me - it's nice living in a real city - even if I haven't met as many new people as I'd hoped to.  Thankfully, I had quite a few friends down here already, which made the move down a lot easier.

As I've mentioned <a href="/2006/05/bookshelf">in passing</a>, I'll be moving really soon.  Jym, Fotios and I will be taking up residence in the Crystal Plaza in <a href="http://crystalcity.com/">Crystal City</a>.  It's less than 5 miles from my current place, but it's a totally different neighborhood.  The place I'm at now isn't too bad, but it's certainly not good.  We'll be on the 9th floor of a much nicer building with some really nice facilities - pool, balcony (overlooking said pool), billiards room, two laundry rooms, two fitness rooms, and a little coffee shop, among other things.  It's also connected to the Crystal City Underground, which is basically an 8-block long underground strip mall, with all sorts of restaurants, shops, and even a couple doctors and dentists.  Within 3 blocks, there are a few more coffee shops, the Metro stop, at least one bar, a liquor store, and much to Jym's delight, there's a McDonald's practically under our building.

We'll be moving next week Tuesday, right after I spend the weekend visiting family and friends in Buffalo and Rochester for Commencement/Memorial Day (and no, I won't be walking).  I started packing up some books and stuff today, because I want to have most of my crap ready to go before I leave Friday.  I'll be back here Monday around noon, then I'm taking a half day Tuesday so I can move in the afternoon.

It's going to be a hectic couple of weeks, and I'm already looking forward to being done with it.  As it is, the living room is full of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/72057594138811505/">Jym's crap</a>, since he moved in last Sunday, and the entire kitchen and bathroom cabinets are in boxes - I had to empty everything out when <a href="/2006/05/schedule-events">pest control</a> visited our building early this month, and never bothered putting it back.

I hate feeling like my world is in disarray, with my stuff in boxes and crap in every corner, but it's much better than the <a href="/2005/11/go-south-young-man">last time I moved</a>; at least I know where I'm going, when, and more or less how I'm going to do it (UHaul, duh).  I just look forward to being through with it.  When all is said and done, my stuff will be in a much nicer place for at least the next year, and my car will be in the capable hands of FN (who needs it much more than I will, sinec I'll be so close to the metro and a mere 8 blocks from work).

Oh, and our place has grills near the pool, and people will be visiting throughout the summer, and I'm going to make it to a couple bluegrass festivals.  This summer is sure to rival last year's.
