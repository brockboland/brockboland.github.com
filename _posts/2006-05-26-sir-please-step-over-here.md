I had a feeling things wouldn't go smoothly at the airport today.  They had me stand in this little glass hallway, with no shoes or belt, right in the middle of the security area, until some guy could take me aside and check me over with the wand.  To most people, this would probably be embarrassing, but I thought it was hilarious.  Turns out, the rivets in my shorts were setting the thing off, so I think I'll be wearing something else for the flight back.

It's been a stressful week.  Jeff, the guy sort of above me, was on vacation for most of the week.  A project for one of our big clients is nearing completion, so I spent the week fielding all the bugs and changes he would usually deal with.  I was also trying to get all my laundry done (it's been accumulating on me for months) and pack all my stuff before leaving for home this afternoon, since we're moving Tuesday and I didn't want to do everything at the last minute again.  I need to figure out how to get to U-Haul Tuesday afternoon, when Jym and I can go over and sign the lease, when we're doing the move-out inspection at my current place, and how I'm going to get back after I drop off the truck Wednesday morning.  And, somewhere in the middle, actually move all our stuff into the new place.

So yes, I've been a little on edge lately.  Things keep popping up - <i>oh crap, I forgot to cancel the cable...and the power</i> - which makes this little balancing act more interesting.  Hopefully, I'll make everything happen at the right times, and it will all go smoothly, and I can sit on my balcony drinking a victory beer Wednesday evening.

Or, as customary, perhaps everything will go wrong in a most spectacular fashion.  Someday we'll look back on this and lauuuugh.  For now, I'm going to enjoy a few days at home and in Rochester and try not to think about any of it.
