<p>I was going to do this at the end of June, but I suppose now is as good a time as any to revisit <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2005/12/2005_i_hardly_knew_ye.php">New Year's resolutions</a>.  Let's review, shall we?</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Spend more time in DC.</b></li>
<p>So far - a bit of a flop.  I haven't been in the District in weeks, and really, I've only been up there to hang out a few times now - our <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2006/04/cherry_blossom_festival_2006.php">Cherry Blossom Fest picnic</a> and <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2006/03/who_says_smoking_is_bad_for_yo.php">St. Patrick's Day</a> are the only memorable days up there.  Perhaps I'll be more inclined to head up now that I'm so close to the Metro, but I've never been the type to just head into the city looking for something to do, so that seems unlikely.  I'll have to work on that.</p>

<li><b>Watch more movies, read more books.</b></li>
<p>So far, I've watched 60 movies this year, and read probably a dozen books, so I'd say this one is going well.  Even so, I'd like to be doing more of both; I've had five Netflix discs sitting around for about a month, and finally <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/">watched one</a> last night and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/">another</a> this afternoon.  With people around all the time, I haven't really had a chance to watch them.  The same goes for books - I was reading more at the old place, but I haven't as much since moving.</p>

<li><b>Do more side projects and write more.</b></li>
<p>Hasn't really happened, but I've been doing some web work for a friend of a friend.  My interest in techie-exploits has been waning, and honestly, I'm just not sure I was meant to be a geek.  As for the writing bit: I would like to be doing more of it, but it just isn't happening.  Once in a while, I'll sit down to write and just draw a blank.  Other times, I have something to write, but not the inclination or time to do it.  I think both of these have fallen by the wayside because I've become more socially involved down here since the beginning of the year; at that point, I hadn't really gotten settled, but now, I'm always hanging out with people and don't need to find other ways to keep myself busy.</p>

<li><b>Make more friends.</b></li>
<p>I'm not sure if this was a resolution that I just didn't announce publicly, or if it came later, but it's not been going as well as I'd like.  I've been hanging out with some of the guys from work once in a while, and met some people through friends that were already here, but I'm still spending most of my time with RIT friends.  And as much as I love them, there aren't a lot of them, and I like meeting new people anyway.</p>

<li><b>Perennial "Seriously, I'm going to lose weight this year (and I mean it this time)."</b></li>
<p>Ummm...yeah.</p>
