Power outages are fun for about half an hour, and then I lose interest in standing on the balcony and playing flashlight Morse code with the folks in the South tower.  It went out Monday night around 9 or 9:30, and didn't come back till about 5 this morning.  It came back for about 30 seconds last night - just long enough for me to do a jig and Fotios to flick the lights on and off to taunt the South tower, which was still dark.

Thankfully, I only had to climb back up the nine flights of stairs once - that part sucked.
