As I tiptoed into the living room and quietly gathered up my pocket litter and keys this morning, I couldn't help but feel like something was out of place.  I snuck into the kitchen - nope, giant pile of trash is still there.  I crept into the living room, stepping over empty cups and bottles to avoid making too much noise - those were right where we left them.

And then I realized the couch seemed unusually flat.  For the first time in a month, no one was sleeping in my living room.

So I turned on the lights and enjoyed me a loud breakfast.
