Friday night included early drunkenness, a rowdy trip to Mackie's, and a way-to-late bedtime.

Yesterday we saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463034/">You, Me, and Dupree</a> (disappointment) and spent the evening in a Japanese karaoke cafe.  A bunch of drunk college kids were in the Metro station <a href="http://www.fingerjoust.com/basics.htm">Finger Jousting</a>, so Schmitty jumped in and beat a couple guys before some cops and WMATA employees came down to investigate all the noise (we did a lot of cheering).

Today, after four loads of laundry, almost everything is clean and I feel accomplished.  Done a little reading, done a little writing, watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349683/">King Arthur</a> (not bad), and relaxed a bit.

Definitely better than <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2006/07/weekend_results_may_vary.php">last weekend</a>, and now I know where all the drunk girls in this city hang out (hint: Japanese karaoke).
