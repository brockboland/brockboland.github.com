<p>Because I've only been living in the DC area for about 8 months don't get out much, I really don't know the city that well yet.  I can find my way around near three or four Metro stops that I frequent, but I print out a map if I'm going anywhere else.</p>

<p>So I can't really complain about the tourists who wander around lost all the time, because I'm in the same boat half the time.  But that doesn't mean I won't.</p>

<p>Family vacation season is just reaching its crescendo, and more and more mid-westerners can be seen wandering around with glazed looks.  For the most part, they stay in DC, but I've been seeing a lot of them lately down here in northern Virginia, where the hotels are cheaper.  You can always spot them if they've got one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Fanny packs</b>.  The tourist staple.  Unacceptable at home, but somehow OK if you're in a different state.</li>

<li><b>DC sweatshirt.</b>  Yes, we're all very happy that you spent your vacation at our nation's capital.  But do you really think it's going to impress anyone here?</li>

<li><b>FBI baseball cap.</b> Same thing.  No one is going to mistake you for an agent, I assure you.</li>

<li><b>T-shirts tucked into shorts.</b>  I'm not convinced this was ever fashionable, anywhere.</li>

<li><b>Cell phone conversation.</b>  "Yeah, we're right by the White House!"  Not even close, buddy.</li>

<li><b>Kids.</b>  Having spent four years in college (not a lot of kids about, there), I didn't even notice their absence here for a month or two.  It seems that no one in DC actually procreates, and I almost never see any in Crystal City...unless they're with a guy who's consulting a map and adjusting his FBI hat while his wife rifles through her fanny pack.</li>
</ul>
