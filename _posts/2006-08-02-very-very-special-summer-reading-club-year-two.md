<p>I haven't heard anything this year about the <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2005/06/very_very_special_summer_readi.php">Very Very Special Summer Reading Club</a>, so I'm assuming it never happened.  Wanna hear what I've been reading?  Of course you do.</p>

<p>I'm going to assume that VVSSRC started mid-May - how's that sound?</p>

<ul>

<p>This woman pretended to be a guy for a year or so and wrote about her relationships with men and dating women.  It's one of those books that usually sounds interesting and doesn't live up to expectations, but Vincent delivers.</p>

<p>A collection of essays from Kevin Smith, many of them from different web sites he's written for.  Smith is a fantastic storyteller, and most of the book reflects that.  Check out <a href="http://www.silentbobspeaks.com/">his blog</a>, too - the stories about his life are always great (the ones about showbiz, not as much).</p>

<p>This was one of those <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/137036212/">super cheap</a> books I got from the Arlington Library a couple months ago.  Dave Barry is always good for summer reading.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2006/07/i_dont_wanna_grow_up.php">wrote about this one</a> already, but once again, I'd recommend this to anyone in the just-after-college age range.</p>

<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0312423799&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Dry: A Memoir</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0312423799" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></b>, by Augusten Burroughs</li>
<p>I fell in love with Burroughs when I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/031242227X&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Running with Scissors</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=031242227X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> back in February.  He's a fantastic storyteller, and with his fucked-up childhood, he's got plenty of material.  This one's about his journey to sobriety.</p>

<p>Again, <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2006/07/i_dont_wanna_grow_up.php">covered it</a>.</p>

<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312315945/">Magical Thinking: True Stories</a></b>, by Augusten Burroughs.</li>
<p>I could rave about Burroughs again, but just trust me and read the book.</p>

<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0345476581&tag=brocklicom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Underdog: How I Survived the World's Most Outlandish Competitions</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=brocklicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0345476581" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></b>, by Joshua Davis</li>
<p>I haven't quite finished this one yet, but I just started it a couple days ago.  I think this one was mentioned in Wired a while ago and it sounded pretty good, but it's been better than I expected.  Davis is a fantastic writer, and it's sort of inspiring to read about these ridiculous competitions he gets himself into and how he does it.  I'm half-tempted to try sumo wrestling after hearing about his experience doing it, and I figure I'd be a lot better at it than a scrawny 130-pound guy.</p>
</ul>

<p>So that's my summer, so far.  I've been reading a lot lately - it's been refreshing.</p>

<p>Your turn.</p>
