<b>Friday</b>
11 hour drive home.  That was fun.  Pittsburgh, as it turns out, isn't the quickest way to Buffalo.

<b>Saturday</b>
Wedding: wedding-y.  Sharon looked all fancy.
Reception: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/72157594245035213/">rowdy</a>.  My cousins are fun, and my parents have loosened up a lot since I moved out.

<b>Sunday</b>
Finished fixing the parents' computer.  Visited Grandma.  Had lunch at DiBella's with BP and Lucas.  Drive home from there only took 7 hours, thank goodness.

Then I got home to find that <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/72157594245043416/">Matt moved all his stuff into our house</a>, but there's a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/220630993/in/set-72157594245043416/">couch on the balcony</a> so it's OK.
