Apparently Google Maps pulls from more than one source, because these two come from TeleAtlas and NAVTEQ (click for the bigger version).  I was looking for the <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/">Trader Joe's</a> in Alexandria and tried to figure out if I could get there without a car, which led to the smaller map in the window on the left.  That one is the walking map provided by <a href="http://www.wmata.com/">WMATA</a>'s Trip Planner, while the bigger one is from the regular <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> site.  I was trying to figure out the discrepancy in Tivoli Passage Alley, and wouldn't have noticed the different sources otherwise.

Anyone know what's going on there?  I did a little looking on Google, but I don't really care enough to devote much time to it.  I can't help but wonder, though, how many different places are ambiguous like this, and if it contributed to the three months I spent driving around this city with no idea where I was going.
