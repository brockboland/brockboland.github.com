It seems that over the past two years, I've heard from a consistent stream of friends and acquaintances who have converted to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/sr=8-1/qid=1157409583/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4961854-2672719?ie=UTF8&s=books">Getting Things Done</a> system.  Most recently, it came up when <a href="http://www.csh.rit.edu/~lewk/blog">Lewk</a> and Schmitty were here last week.  Lewk whipped out his well-worn copy and explained how he's been keeping track of things on to-do lists and the like.

And then I realized, it's been ages since I had a real to-do list.

Obviously, I keep one at work, because I always seem to forget the minor details in my pursuit of the bigger picture.  And I've still got a list of project ideas that I've had running for a few years now.  But really, I haven't kept a running, daily-consulted to-do list since I finished classes.  In a way, it's been kind of nice: I've felt relatively free from responsibility.  I've done a lot of reading.  I've put a significant dent in the list of movies I hadn't seen (that list doesnt count, since I never really made it).  I can't really say I've accomplished much, though.

I think it's time for that to change.  I've been feeling listless lately, like I'm not sure what to do with myself, and having some personal projects on deck would certainly help.  But then, what to do?  I'm losing interest in programming; it's not the kind of thing I can do all day at work, and then do at home for fun.  I keep saying that I want to write more.  I've got the time, and I've got the means, but I don't have the inspiration.  I have some ideas, but when I actually go to write them down, I don't know what to say.

Lewk mentioned that writing things down has helped him be more creative.  It's true that I tend to be more stressed when I lay in bed each night, mentally re-hashing everything that needs to be done in the coming days.  I still carry my <a href=/archives/2005/02/the_hipster_pda.php">Hipster PDA</a>, but haven't used it much lately.  I also got in on the <a href="http://www.moleskinerie.com/">Moleskine craze</a> a little late, but I've been jotting notes and making lists in there a bit more lately.  It's tough to get in the habit of making a quick note when ideas occurr to me.

I'm hoping that Lewk is right, though: maybe taking a couple minutes to get things out of my head and onto paper will allow other things some breathing room.
