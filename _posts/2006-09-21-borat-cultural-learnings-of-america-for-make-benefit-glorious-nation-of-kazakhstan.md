Fucking hilarious.  It won't be out for another month, but you need to see it as soon as possible.  I can't believe he wasn't arrested or severly beaten in the course of filming.

Gotta love those free screenings.  It was totally worth the three-hour wait and $14 cab ride home from Georgetown, and even dealing with MySpace to get the pass.
