This was the best festival I've been to yet.  The Grillbillie turnout was lower than usual, and there were definitely folks I missed, but there were also a lot of people that I was really hoping to see.  And I got to spend a lot of time with everyone, too - everybody pretty much stuck around Grillbillie Hall.

Adam bought himself a new camper over in Delaware, and literally picked it up on his way to the festival.  When he pulled in, we filled the place with people (and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/251720332/">a tree</a>) and did some exploring.  The guy who sold it to him left everything in it (dishes, bedding, cleaning stuff - everything), and since Adam had bought the thing just two hours before, he never got a chance to clean it out or figure out where things were before we got our hands on it (FN did manage to find himself <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/251720659/">his own room</a>).

On Saturday afternoon, Amy sent me a text message from the other end of the camper - "I deem you a official grillbillie."

"Can you even do that?" I yelled back to her.

"Of course I can, I'm an original.  Go see what Matt says."

So I showed Matt the message, and he goes, "I thought you WERE official.  You're not going to fit into an extra large, are you?"

So I don't have a t-shirt yet, but three years after the festival where I first met them, I've become an official Grillbillie.  Definitely my best festival yet.
