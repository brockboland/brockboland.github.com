<p>I've always loved October.  When I was a kid, it was because of Halloween and my birthday - what five-year old doesn't like presents and candy?  Besides that, autumn has always been my favorite season, but especially October.  I know you're thinking that, technically, it's still September, to which I say, technically, so's your face.</p>

<p>Reasons it's great:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>It's cooler outside.</b>  Those 95 degree days with 98% humidity sucked, a lot.</li>

<li><b>Football!</b>  Started in September, but it gets going full-swing in October.</li>

<li><b>Cider.</b>  Who doesn't love cider? </li>

<li><b>Pumpkins.</b>  Most especially, Starbucks' pumpkin spice latte and pumpkin scones.  Love 'em!  I picked up a six-pack of pumpkin ale for the first time this year, and wasn't impressed by the first bottle, but I think it'll grow on me, just like St. Pauli Girl did.</li>

<li><b>Leaves.</b>  It's just so pretty out there, don'tcha think?</li>
</ol>
