<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/">The Departed</a> was just as good as I was expecting.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197/">Jack Nicholson</a> was perfect for the part, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> was better than I figured he would be (fella's never been too good with accents, though).  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000242/">Marky Mark</a> played the same character as he did in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430105/">Four Brothers</a>, more or less, but it works for him.

It's nearly two and a half hours long, but really didn't feel like it - Scorsese kept things moving at a good pace.  There were a lot of incredibly funny lines that I can't remember now (mostly from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000285/">Alec Baldwin</a>) and just enough action to keep things lively until the back-and-forth twisted ending that capped it all off quite nicely.

I'd definitely pay to see it again.  Check it out this weekend.
