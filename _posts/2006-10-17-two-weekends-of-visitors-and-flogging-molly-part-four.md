It's been a couple weeks since I've written much of anything, but let's make this quick, shall we?

About a week and a half ago, my parents and youngest brother came to visit for a long weekend.  We hit some museums, looked at some monuments, and spent a lot of time just hanging out.  I was the de facto tour guide, but since I don't know the city terribly well, we almost got lost a couple times.  I took some pictures - <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/sets/72157594322392861/" target="_blank">see</a>?

This past weekend, BP, Otto, and Freshman came down to visit.  We spent most of the weekend drinking and BBQ-ing, and I'm still recovering from it all, but it was wonderful.  During the BBQ (and after a number of drinks), BP and I agreed that we would get tattoos together on Monday.  Turns out, I had to work and he had to drive back to New York, so that didn't happen, but it will sooner or later.

On Sunday night, BP and I drove up to Baltimore to see <a href="http://www.floggingmolly.com/" target="_blank">Flogging Molly</a> (the fourth time I've seen them, the third time with BP) at <a href="http://www.ramsheadlive.com/" target="_blank">Rams Head Live</a>.  The venue was pretty good for it - medium-sized and conveniently located on the closer side of Baltimore. <a href="http://www.zoxband.com/" target="_blank">Zox</a> (not bad) and <a href="http://www.bedouinsoundclash.com/" target="_blank">Bedouin Soundclash</a> ("horribly average," as a guy at the bar described them) opened the show, and thankfully, neither of them did a full set like <a href="/2006/02/flogging-molly-take-three">the last time</a>.  During Bedouin Soundclash's set, Nathan Maxwell (the bassist) came out from backstage and hung out with the crowd between the bar and the pit.  I wandered over to shake his hand, mostly so I can say I touched a Molly.

BP and I made our way into the pit about 15 minutes before Molly took the stage, and, being a few beers deep, spent the entire time getting the crowd around us riled up with sing-alongs, stretching exercises, and bare-knuckle fisticuffs.  It was definitely the best show of the four times I've seen them - the crowd was fantastic, I had just the right amount to drink beforehand, and I even managed to hang onto a bottle of water in the pit (you get thirsty in there).  Dave King came back out alone for the encore and did the first half of Black Friday Rule acoustic, before the rest of the band jumped in.  It was OK, but definitely didn't touch the thirteen-minute version.  The openers could have been better, and we could have convinced more friends to come with us, but really, the show was so good in so many respects that I can't complain.

It was a rowdy rowdy weekend, and totally worth the hurt Monday morning.  Right now, I think I need a weekend without extra people around, but I'm already looking forward to the next big party here at Brockstone Manor.
