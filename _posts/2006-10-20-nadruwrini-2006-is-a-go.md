Thanks to <a href="http://www.weirdsmobile.com/b/" target="_blank">Miss Hannah</a>, I've learned that <a href="http://rulebrittaniea.org/2006/10/18/the-drunk-is-nigh/" target="_blank">Brittanie</a> has made a post concerning NaDruWriNi, which is good because now I don't have to worry about it, and I wasn't entirely clear on the rules as it was, not that I'll be following them anyhow, but that bit's beside the point.

The point, of course, is that I'll be falling-down drunk on Saturday, November 4th, and I'll be sharing it with all of you.  I won't be doing any <i>real</i> writing, to be sure - I can barely handle that when I'm sober, even if I don't do as much of it as I'd like.  No no, good people, you'll be getting the grittiest, tritest, unfiltered-est crap that wanders haphazardly into the path of my train of thought, and very little of it is likely to make sense even to me, unless I stumble on some nugget of staggering genius regarding the existence of thought and humanity, in which case I hope I can draw a meaningful picture that will make sense in the morning.

I encourage you all to join me.  For you locals, I'll probably begin the evening with a few mixed drinks here at my place, then head down to the pub for a few pints (this part will hopefully feature notes scribbled furiously in my Moleskine), then stumble back here again, where I can be left alone while I beg the room to just sit still for a damn minute so I can find the pisser.  Surely, it will be an evening to remember.


PS: I've had a couple of Jack & Coke's this evening.  Not only do I participate in NaDruWriNi, I even practice weeks beforehand.  That's how dedicated I am.
