Yes, it was my birthday.  I'm 23.  Whooptie-do.

Work sucked.  I left early after spending most of the afternoon running in circles trying to solve problems with the project I'm working on.

I came home and fell asleep for a couple hours, which was nice.  Sharon and Gavin had a Halloween party tonight, so I caught the Metro out that way.  And then I got a bus to their house, except I got on going the wrong direction.  Thankfully, I realized it before I got too far, and Sharon drove out to save me.  The party was a blast, and a nice contrast to the rest of the day.

Since the buses stop running around 11 or 12, I called a cab to get back to the Metro to get home, and arrived five minutes after the last train, which came a half hour earlier than I thought (it's worth noting that the cab took 35 minutes to get to their place).  I hopped in another cab to get home.  In the end, it cost me $38 to get back from Falls Church.  Incidentally, that's about how much I spend on gas when I drive from Arlington, VA to Rochester, NY.

I never got a chance to eat dinner, so I'm starving.  I'm going to make a sandwich, and I'm going to watch some TV, and tomorrow had damn well better be pretty fucking great.

Also, I have hiccups.  Perfect.
