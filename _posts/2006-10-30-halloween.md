I'm not sure how many people dressed up as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Foley" target="_blank">Mark Foley</a> this year, but I was one of them.  I figured it would be easy, and it was - I just wore a button-up white shirt and called it a night.

As it turns out, though, not many of my friends' friends follow the news.  People would say, "Who are you?" and I'd reply with something inappropriate, like, "I'm Mark Foley.  Let's wrestle in our underpants!"

Maybe a quarter of the people at the party got it.  One guy said something about a cage match (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Foley" target="_blank">Mick Foley</a>, of WWF) and someone else warned me to stay away from the coffee table (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Foley" target="_blank">Matt Foley</a>, of SNL).

I was worried about offending people, but I think the responses I got mean we have much more to be worried about.
