As I've mentioned <a href="/2006/10/public-transportation">at least once</a>, I no longer have my car, Malique, because FN is taking care of her for now.

It is with a heavy heart that I report that Malique has been <a href="http://www.cmarcera.org/gallery/home/deer110706/" target="_blank">hit by a deer</a>.  I'm sure she'll make it through - she IS made of plastic, after all - but we're all pretty broken up here at Brockstone Manor, and hope you'll keep her (and the deer) (and, come to think of it, FN) in your thoughts.
