After my <a href="/archives/2006/11/stupid_immune_system.php">post on Monday</a> I was asleep by 9.  I felt OK yesterday, and despite a lot of coughing and sneezing, I felt just fine most of today, but now I'm getting achey and tired.  This has better clear up tomorrow, because I'm got Friday off and I've got big plans.

Also, we won the House, Rummy done quit, Britney done split, Virginia's on the fence for a couple more weeks and maybe I should have voted, but I don't technically live here.
