A lot of people in this town use those wireless headsets with their cell phones.  There's a lot of good reasons to hate those, but my biggest complaint about them is people using them when they're just walking around town.

On my way home last night, I was feeling pretty crappy (that <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2006/11/still_kind_of_sick.php">sick business</a>).  I passed this chubby guy in a lime green shirt, a purple tie, and a black fleece vest, with a rolly-bag and an armload of crap.  Just as I was passing him, he said, "There's hope," in the kind of voice you'd expect to hear from a chubby guy in a green shirt and purple tie.  He may have had a hands-free thing, since his hands WERE full, but he definitely looked like he was talking to me.  I guess I looked like I needed a little up-lifting.

Then, on my way in this morning, I was having a cigarette (I know, I'm a terrible person).  At the same place I passed the guy yesterday, another dude said, "Doesn't wo-ork," in a sort of sing-songy lilt.  Perhaps he meant smoking, as a weight-loss strategy?  His hands weren't full, so if he was using a headset, he's just an asshat.

Now I'm wondering if I'm the kind of guy that looks like he needs unsolicited input from strangers, or if these guys just don't know the <a href="http://www.manlaws.com/" target="_blank">Man Laws</a>.  I'll let you know how the walk home tonight goes.
