I just spent 20 minutes riding hard on the bike at the gym, and then I came home and poured myself a tall glass of vitamin-rich orange juice.

Then I looked at the side of the carton and saw that my healthy glass of OJ contained more calories than the bike claimed I burned while I was there.

That's kinda depressing.
