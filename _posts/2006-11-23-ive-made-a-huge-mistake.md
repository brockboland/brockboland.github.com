My chin feels funny.  And cold.

I haven't actually seen it in about two and a half years, but today was one of those days when I just couldn't get the sides of my goatee even, and it just kept getting smaller and smaller until all I had was this little strip in the middle of my butt-chin, which, incidentally, is damn near impossible to shave.

What a way to start Thanksgiving.  We had a good run, and I'll grow it back as soon as I can.  For now, I need to see if I still own a scarf.
