I'm still not happy about missing <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2006/11/ive_made_a_huge_mistake.php">my goatee</a>, but the really cute waitress at Bailey's commented on its disappearance tonight.  She claims that my butt chin is a genetic rarity, much like her adorable dimples.

Not such a bad shaving accident after all.
