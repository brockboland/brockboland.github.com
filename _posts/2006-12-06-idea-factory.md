The best ideas come while I'm in the shower or walking between home and work.  My <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2005/09/shower_whiteboard.php">shower whiteboard idea</a> was borne out of this (but I never did <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2006/01/thieving_bastards.php">order one</a>), and on days like today, I'll stop at a bus stop bench to scribble things down before I forget (sure do love that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00092RPH0?ie=UTF8&tag=brocklicom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00092RPH0">Moleskine</a>).

It would seem that taking more walks or spending more time in the shower might spur some creativity, but that's not how it works.  If I'm actually TRYING to think of something, it doesn't happen; I have to let my mind wander, because most times I'll have a great idea about something unrelated to what I AM thinking about.

The obvious solution is to wander around town in a drunken stupor, because then I can't actively think about anything.  I'll let you know how it goes.
