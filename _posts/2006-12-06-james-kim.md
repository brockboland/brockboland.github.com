Ten days ago, I hadn't even heard of <a href="http://news.com.com/James+Kim+found+deceased/2100-1028_3-6141498.html?tag=cnetfd.ld1">James Kim</a>.  He first came across my radar a day or two after he and his family went missing, when a few bloggers posted to ask if anyone had seen or heard from him.  Since then, the family has come across my news reader more and more, culminating with the rescue of his wife and children on Monday.

For a few days, it was hard for me to understand how this family could have disappeared.  I'm used to being in the middle of any major winter storms, and I didn't even realize that the rest of the country was getting socked with snow until after it had happened.

I just read that James' body was found earlier today, and despite the fact that I didn't even know his name last week, I can't help but feel for him and his family.  His was the kind of experience every father prays they won't have to face, and just thinking about it makes me wonder how I'd fare in his position.  I can't imagine what that family went through this past week, or what they're going through now.  I can't offer prayers, but my thoughts are with them.
