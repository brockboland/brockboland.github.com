Just so we're all on the same page:

I don't think I've ever been this stressed.  We've been double-secret busy at work (got <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2006/11/keepin_busy.php">what I wished for</a>, no?) and then I got another short-term high-speed project on top of everything else, so I've been extra pissy this past week.  And did I mention that I haven't had a cigarette in over three weeks?  That's been going pretty well, but I won't lie: I'm ready to put a hammer through something, and I don't much care what it is.

Also, I hear that Christmas is coming up, but I've been too busy to think about it.  If you've got gift ideas for my family, please share.
