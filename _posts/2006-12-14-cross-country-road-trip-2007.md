Obviously, <a href="/archives/2005/07/east_coast_bike_tour_2006.php">East Coast Bike Tour 2006</a> isn't going to happen in the next two weeks.  But!  I can plan for the coming year, can't I?  As such, I've made bigger and better and more awesome plans for next year's road trip.  This means, of course, that I need to find me a bike with saddle bags sometime in the next eight months or so, except I don't have any money.

Donations always accepted, of course.
