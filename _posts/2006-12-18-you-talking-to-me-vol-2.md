Today marks the second installment of a series I like to call Strangers Without Candy, But Plenty of Nonsensical Advice (<a href="/2006/11/you-talking-me">Vol. 1</a>).

Just after leaving my building this morning, a nice looking guy in a suit and trench coat was walking toward me, pulling a big black suitcase behind him.  When he was about 15 feet in front of me, just before I passed under a raised walkway, he turned left and cut in front of me.  I don't know why I looked up at him, but he was looking me right in the eyes and said: "Turn right message."  Then he disappeared behind the support column for the walkway above.

And I thought, "Turn right message indeed, friend.  Turn right message indeed."
