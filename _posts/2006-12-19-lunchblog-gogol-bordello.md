<a href="http://www.gogolbordello.com/">Gogol Bordello</a> is headlining a sold-out show tonight at <a href="http://www.930.com">9:30</a>, and I don't have tickets.  I SHOULD have tickets, because I knew about this months ago, but I kept putting it off.

No matter; my point here is that they sold out a headlining show at a pretty big venue, which is a big step from the <a href="/archives/2005/08/flogging_molly_round_two.php">first time I saw them</a>, opening for Flogging Molly in a small venue in Binghamton (still a pretty good gig, but they're definitely moving up in the world).  I do feel a little of the requisite "I loved them back before anyone knew them and now they're popular and I think they suck," but I'm happy that they're doing well.  I'll catch them next time.
