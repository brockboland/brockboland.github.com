For those of you unhappy with my <a href="/2006/12/magic-hat">opinion of Circus Boy</a>, rest assured: I tried Widmer's Hefeweizen last night.

And I was underwhelmed.

It was bland.  Not TOO bland; I mean, I'd drink it again for sure, but it definitely didn't have as much flavor as Circus Boy.  Like Tom said, that may be because I don't know what a hefeweizen is "supposed" to taste like, but all the same, I think it's delicious.
