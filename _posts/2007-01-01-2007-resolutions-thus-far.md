<p>Now that we're a full twelve hours (and change) into the new year, I think it's about time for a little self-evaluation with regards to resolutions.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Go to the gym:</b>  It's where I started my day.</li>
<li><b>Spend less time just hanging out in the apartment:</b>  I've already been out of the apartment TWICE.  I know some people (ahem, roommates) who aren't even out of bed yet.</li>
<li><b>Get a handle on my finances:</b>  Unless you count the bill payments I scheduled online last night (they'll be processed in the next couple of days), I haven't spent a dime.  I DID go down to <a href="/2006/12/my-very-own-bookstore">Olsson's</a> (second trip out of the apartment) looking for a <a href="http://www.moleskineus.com/largeweekly.html">Moleskine daily planner</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQE?ie=UTF8&tag=brocklicom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000K7VHQE">Little Miss Sunshine</a> DVD, but they had neither so I'm still doing OK.</li>
<li><b>Be more positive about life in general:</b>  I'm just bursting with joy this morning.</li>
<li><b>Try brewing beer:</b>  Not yet.  Maybe I'll start small: "Try drinking beer."</li>
<li><b>Do more personal projects:</b>  I took care of a lot of little crap this morning - the kind of stuff that only takes ten minutes, but just keeps getting put off.  I've also started plans for a big project that's been percolating for a few weeks and combined all my little to-do lists of smaller projects, so I know what I'm up against.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not so bad, eh?  I think we can all agree that 2007 is already a strong contender for Best Year In The Second Half of This Decade So Far.</p>
