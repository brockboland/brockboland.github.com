I don't know if anyone besides <a href="http://jymferrier.net/" target="_blank">Jym</a> has tried the <a href="/projects/lj-comment-grabber/">LJ Comment Grabber</a>, but I fixed the comment parsing...sort of.  Read the project page for more details.  If you are using it, this is definitely an update you want to get.
