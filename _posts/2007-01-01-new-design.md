Like the new look?  Of course you do.

I upgraded to MT 3.2 <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2006/01/my_relationship_with_spam_or_d.php">almost a year ago</a>, and "re-design blog" has been on my to-do list ever since.  The default template isn't bad, but I definitely didn't care for the grey-blue crap.  So, I stripped out most of the coloring, touched up some borders, and brought back the random banner images (who doesn't love random banner images?).  I've got about a dozen of them from the old design and I'll be adding more when I get around to it - collect them all!
