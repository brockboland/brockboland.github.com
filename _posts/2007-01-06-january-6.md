Waking up in my apartment this morning was very much like living in the RIT dorms in late spring or early fall: it's 80 degrees in my room, the air conditioning is useless, and all I can do is throw open the windows (and here, my balcony door) and sit really still, waiting for a cool breeze.  When I look outside, there are people in shorts and t-shirts playing soccer out in the quad (er, the building's courtyard).

I know they say that Global Warming only causes small temperature changes over several years, and that this unusual heat is all thanks to El Ni√±o, but if this is an indication of what's to come, I'm moving to Canada.  I'm also wondering if our summer will also be abnormally warm, in which case I won't be leaving my apartment between April and October.

But we'll worry about that then.  For now, I need to find some shorts so BP, Klem and I can go do whatever it is we're going to do today.
