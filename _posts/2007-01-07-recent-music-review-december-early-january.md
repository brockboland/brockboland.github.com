<p>I haven't been listening to music much this past month.  I think it's because I've been wearing glasses instead of contacts for most of the past month: I wear headphones when I'm listening to music at work, and they get uncomfortable quick with glasses on.</p>

<p>So, it's a short list this month, but that's OK.  I just want to cross it off my to-do list.</p>

<h2>Albums</h2>

<p><b><a href="http://www.cowboymouth.com/">Cowboy Mouth</a> - Voodoo Lounge</b>
<br />
I saw these guys open for Barenaked Ladies about eight years ago, when I was a sophomore in high school.  It was the first concert I'd been to, so it was more memorable for that than for their music.  They came back across my radar when they released Easy in the summer of 2002, and I listened to them quite a bit three years later when I was working for the College of Business.  They're a fun, upbeat, slightly southern rock band, so they make good programming music.  They also hail from New Orleans, so a couple songs on this disc address Katrina and the aftermath.  My favorites: Joe Strummer, a send-up to the late Clash singer, and I Told Ya.
</p>

<h2>Singles</h2>

<p><b><a href="http://www.the-sounds.com/">The Sounds</a> - Living In America</b>
<br />
I have no idea when or how I got this MP3, but it came up on shuffle a few weeks ago and I love it.
</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.teddybearsrock.com/">Teddybears</a> (feat. Iggy Pop) - Punkrocker</b>
<br />
These guys got two mentions <a href="/2006/11/recent-music-review-late-november">last month</a>, but Punkrocker is definitely the best yet.  I've never been an Iggy Pop fan - in fact, I'm not even sure I've heard anything other than Lust for Life - so I can't really tell you how this compares to his previous work.  The best I can do to describe this track is mellow indie-synth, with a tired-sounding Iggy crooning on top.  The Godfather of Punk is getting old - he'll be sixty this year - and he may still be in good shape, but it shows in his voice.
</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.thenewpornographers.com/">The New Pornographers</a> - Use It</b>
<br />
Technically, this was mentioned last month as part of the Twin Cinema album, but I'm still listening to it a lot.  It's just a really good track.
</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.thenewpornographers.com/">The New Pornographers</a> - The Slow Descent into Alcoholism</b>
<br />
This was on Mass Romantic, but it's become one of my favorite Pornographers tracks of late.
</p>
