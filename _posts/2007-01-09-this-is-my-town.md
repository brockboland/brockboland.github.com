Does anyone else feel like they don't really have a home town?

I sort of keep in touch with two friends from grade school, one via <a href="http://aplaceiveneverseen.blogspot.com/">a blog</a> and the other via the occasional AIM chat every couple months.  When I'm actually home, I hang out with one guy who I graduated with, a couple guys that were younger, and a handful of guys that I didn't even know back then.  Aside from my family, there are only a couple of people I feel close to back in the Buffalo area.

It seems like everyone has their crew of friends back home that they grew up with.  Is it unusual that I don't?
