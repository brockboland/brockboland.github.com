I do love these three day weekends, but I always come up with an ambitious list of things that need doin', and then I keep putting them off because, hey, it's a three day weekend, and then I find myself sitting on the couch at 10 Monday evening with nothing to show for my weekend.

But I suppose that's OK.  I had a nice long chat with Mel and watched some movies and finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802140149?ie=UTF8&tag=brocklicom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0802140149">one book</a> and then read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375423974?ie=UTF8&tag=brocklicom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0375423974">another one</a> this afternoon and relaxed and slept in and made some chicken salad.  I never did get around to doing laundry, but it's OK because I bought a bunch of socks and underwear a few weeks ago, so I can go a lot longer between laundry days now.

Weekends like this are nice now and again, but I think I'd go crazy if they were all this mellow.  But, last weekend featured a visit from BP and Klem, and the New Year was before that, and Christmas before that, and in another couple weeks I'm off to San Francisco for a bit, so it's all good.  I'll have time to learn Ruby on Rails later.
