I just found my Social Security Card AND my Selective Service Card!  I made the rookie mistake of putting them somewhere safe.

I think I might be getting to the point in my life where I should start looking into a fire-proof safe.  Jym has a briefcase-sized one and graciously allowed me to store the one thing that I knew needed fire-proof protection: a DVD backup of my photos, college classwork, and some other files.  But now that I think about it, I should really be more worried about my Social Security Card, birth certificate, diploma, transcripts, medical records - that sort of stuff.  A quick glance at Google shows that small safes aren't nearly as expensive as I thought.

This is the sort of thing that's really easy to put off - when everything is going fine, you don't worry about making backups and you don't worry about what you'll save in a fire.  So far this year, I've been pretty good about my spending, but I think I can make an exception for this, because I may regret it if I don't

I'm also going to get a paper shredder, because they seem more practical than the duct-taped wad of sensitive documents that I burn every year or so.  Plus, they're fun.
