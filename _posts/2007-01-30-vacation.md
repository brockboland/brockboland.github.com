Remember that time we went <a href="/archives/2005/11/nadruwrini_part_5_epilogue.php">dumpster diving</a>?  Well, it's time to cash in reward points, fly out to San Francisco, and spend a week with the wonderful <a href="http://www.ryandoherty.net/">Ryan</a> and <a href="http://www.sarahfriedlander.com/blog/">Sarah</a>.  I leave Thursday evening and come back Sunday morning.

I was talking to Sarah ealier today and realized that I haven't had a break this long since I was 15.  I worked all through high school and college, so school breaks just meant more work.  I do long weekends out of town once in a while, but the longest break I've had in the past seven years was last November, before I moved to DC - I finished finals Friday morning and had a week and a half before starting my job on a Tuesday.  That hardly counts as a break, though: I did a ton of driving - three laps between Rochester and DC - packed up and moved all my stuff, AND spent a weekend partying with the Grillbillies.

Of course, now that I really think about it, I had forgotten the 10-day trip to Las Vegas three years ago.  I guess that counts.

Either way, I'm psyched.  I could stand to get out of here for a bit, and I'm looking forward to seeing the whole SF crew.
