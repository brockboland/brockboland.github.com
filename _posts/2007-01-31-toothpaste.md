I just noticed that my toothpaste top can flip up OR twist off (it even has printed instructions) (actually, that's the only reason I noticed).  Why didn't they think of that sooner?  (And why do I feel like I should have a preference?)

Also: I almost forgot about it, but as of last Thursday, I've been doing this thing for <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2005/01/feelgood_hit_ofjanuary.php">two years</a>.
