I don't want to bore anyone with the details of my day, but I DO want to write this down, lest I forget it.  Or need proof that I did it.  You know, just in case.

Ryan dropped me off at the train station this morning so I could spend the day up in San Francisco.  Unfortunately, it started raining about half an hour after I got up there and didn't stop till I left.  But, I made the best of it.

Nuzz and I had lunch at <a href="http://www.asqewgrill.com/">Asqew</a>, and then I hopped a bus down to Wendy's place.  We caught another bus over to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haight-Ashbury">Haight-Ashbury</a>, picked up some CDs at <a href="http://www.amoeba.com/">Amoeba Music</a>, had coffee and played Pac Man at a cool little coffee shop, and got a drink and some wings at <a href="http://www.magnoliapub.com/">Magnolia</a>.  Then we got on <b>another</b> bus to go back to her place to grab some stuff to catch a cab to catch a train to meet Ryan, Sarah, Jordan and Tristan in Palo Alto for dinner.

It was a fun (albeit tiring) day, despite the rain.  I think I kinda like this city.

Tomorrow is for sleeping.  There's a sushi place nearby that Ryan and Sarah swear by, so I think I'm going to grab lunch there, and then it's off to the airport in the evening.  I'm not ready to go back.

PS: You know that song San Francisco ("Be sure to WEEEARRR, some flowers in your hair")?  It's been stuck in my head all week.
