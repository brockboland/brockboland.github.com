Atlanta is downright bustling, which seems odd, because as far as I'm concerned, it's still 3:30 AM.  From my perspective, I left Ryan and Sarah's place after dinner, sat around for a little bit, and now it's morning.

AirTran oversold business class on my flight here, so I got stuck in coach, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Of course, I couldn't really sleep at all, and sleep at the gate is out of the question, thanks to InStyle playing loudly on a number of TVs (on the other hand, I've learned that a third guy is claiming Anna Nicole Smith's baby, and that Ugly Betty's favorite beauty product is water.  Riveting stuff.)

And now they're re-capping the Smith story.  I guess it's been a quiet week.

I can't decide if I should get some coffee or try to sleep through the TV.  Sleeping might just make it worse, but my schedule will be all messed up if my Friday lasts until noon on Saturday.

I can't even really think straight.  I'll get back to you when I get home.
