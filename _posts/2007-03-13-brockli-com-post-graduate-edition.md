<li>Poop jokes are still funny.  From one of my recent favorites, Dethroner.com ("Where every man is king"): <a href="http://dethroner.com/2007/03/13/a-brief-guide-to-public-restroom-etiquette/">A Brief Guide to Public Restroom Etiquette</a>.</li>
<li>This evening I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113537/">Kicking and Screaming</a>, which was very much like someone predicted, ten years ahead of time, my first year after college.
<blockquote>
I'm nostalgic for conversations I had yesterday. I've begun reminiscing events before they even occur. I'm reminiscing this right now. I can't go to the bar because I've already looked back on it in my memory... and I didn't have a good time.
</blockquote></li>
<li>This past weekend was <a href="http://www.shamrockfest.com/">Shamrockfest</a>, and I had a full house for it: BP and JL came Thursday night, Eric, Tasia, and Fonny on Friday, and Dan came Saturday morning (in addition, of course, to Mel, Jym, and myself).  The actual festival was a lot of fun, but the rest of the weekend topped even that.  The thing I miss most about college is the ease with which I could pull together a dozen close friends for a weekend-long party at the drop of a hat.</li>
<li>That's about it.  Now that this past weekend is behind me, I'm back to being <a href="/2007/03/oof">busybusybusy</a>, and probably will be for another month or so.</li>
</ul>
