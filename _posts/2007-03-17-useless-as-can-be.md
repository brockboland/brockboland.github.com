It was pretty rainy all day yesterday, so I used the tunnels to walk to work.  Along the way, I came up behind a woman who was wearing open-back, slip-on shoes that looked like the bottom part of galoshes.  Each of them was like one-sixth of a galosh, and I couldn't help but think they'd be pretty useless on a rainy day like that.  The lady was meandering along pretty slowly, and since we were close to the Metro, this flood of more-hurried people behind her kept trying to get past without running into the people coming from the other direction.

She was wearing a FEMA Evacuation Team windbreaker, and I couldn't imagine anything more appropriate.
