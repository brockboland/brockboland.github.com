Autumn has always been my favorite season, but spring is a close second, especially when spring feels like this.  I couldn't ask for a nicer evening, unless I was really really greedy.  It's a perfect 78 degrees with 19% humidity here in lovely Arlington, VA, and I'm taking advantage of it while I can, because we all know that in a few short weeks, it's going to be 88 degrees with 90% humidity.

But let's not dwell on that.  Right now, I'm sitting outside, enjoying a Flying Dog, and inexplicably, a bunch of maple tree whirlygigs just went spinning past my ninth-floor balcony.  I can't complain.

<b>UPDATE:</b> Wait, do maple trees have whirlygigs?  We had a ton of them in my front yard when I was growing up, but now that I think about it, they may have come from the other tree.
