<b>Things I liked about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456554/">Grandma's Boy</a>:</b>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004802/">cute girl</a> from Freaks & Geeks.  She's cute.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0841910/">Nick Swardson</a>.  He's a funny guy.  His stand-up is hilarious, and I loved him in Blades of Glory.</li>
</ul>

<p>OK, maybe that's not fair.  A few lines made me laugh pretty hard, but on the whole, it was like a barely-entertaining sitcom that lasted almost two hours.  If it were a series, I'd only watch it if it was on and I were too drunk to change the channel.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0184445/">Allen Covert</a> sounds like Jon Stewart (and even looks like a slightly younger version of him), and he may be Adam Sandler's buddy, but Jesus Christ is he an awful actor.  It was sort of like watching a seventh-grade production of Fiddler on the Roof: the script ain't half bad, but the performance wasn't "acted" so much as "spoken word for word."  I probably would have liked it more if someone else played Alex (and I was baked out of my mind), but that's neither here nor there.</p>

<p>I give it a D, because it may have been awful, but it was good for a few laughs.</p>

<p>Also, the scenes with all the tester geeks were hilarious.</p>
