If you liked <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/">Shaun of the Dead</a> - and especially if you also liked <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172156/">Bad Boys II</a> - you're going to love <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/">Hot Fuzz</a>.  I got to see it last night thanks to a pre-screening and Ryan's generosity (he won passes and took me along).  As the guys on <a href="http://revision3.com/trs">The Totally Rad Show</a> said, EVERYTHING in the movie sets up for the climatic scene, or at least some later joke.  I absolutely love the sense of humor these guys have - there were so many subtle jokes throughout the entire flick, and a lot of times I was the only one laughing.  It may not be everyone's taste, but I love it.

I'll be seeing it again this weekend with the <a href="http://www.sundaynightfilmclub.com/sub/dc/">Sunday Night Film Club</a>.  We're going to the 4:45 show at the Georgetown AMC Loews, and you DC folks should join us.
