Friends: I need a good way to keep track of my contacts - phone numbers, addresses, web sites, things like that.  I'm not too fond of Address Book or Outlook, and really, I'd prefer something web-based so I can get to it anywhere.  I considered buying a cheap Palm (or equivalent), but don't really want to spend money, or carry another device, or have a single fail-point.

Anyone know a site that's free, reliable, and won't sell my friends to spammers?
