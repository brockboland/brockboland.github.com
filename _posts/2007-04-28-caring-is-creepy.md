(Another old, unfinished entry from July 11, 2005.  I'm not sure where I was going with this, so I haven't changed it.)

Whatever happened to the idealism of childhood?  As one comedian (whose name I've forgotten) put it, "why isn't this a room full of firemen and ballerinas?"  Kids don't like going to the doctor, so why do so many say that's what they want to be when they grow up?

Children seem to have an innate sense of responsibility for the public good.  When does the human decency fade away?  At some point, everyone is stricken with cynicism and becomes jaded with the world around them.

I love driving down some of the back roads near home and seeing stands at the road with fresh vegetables and a money jar.  In some places, people can still rely on the honesty of others without being ripped off.  Some people still believe that people are good and won't take advantage of others at the first opportunity.
