(Another old, unpublished post from April 4, 2005.  Didn't change anything.)

One of the books I've been in the middle of for weeks is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/068487315X/ref=sib_rdr_dp/102-5259774-2708901">Fear and Loathing in America, vol 2</a>, by Hunter S. Thompson.  It's a collection of letters he wrote between 1968 and 1976 to "a virtual who's who of the era."

No one writes letters these days.  No one uses typewriters.  The immediacy of desktop publishing and e-mail has taken something away from the meaning of the written word.  Will our generation leave behind letters to be found in the attic by our grandchildren in 40 or 50 years?  Unlikely.
