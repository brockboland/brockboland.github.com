Holy crap I'm slacking.  It's been damn near four months since I've posted <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2007/01/recent_music_review_decemberea.php">one of these</a>, so this is going to be an abridged version.

<b>January</b>

At some point, I got <a href="http://www.theweepies.com/">The Weepies'</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBCOMW?ie=UTF8&tag=brocklicom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000EBCOMW">Say I Am You</a>, a very mellow, folksy indie rock album that I listened to non-stop for about a week.

The last weekend in January, I was wandering around DC and protesting the war with a bunch of people.  We stopped into a Starbucks, I grabbed the <a href="http://www.decemberists.com/">Decemberists'</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HKDEEW?ie=UTF8&tag=brocklicom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000HKDEEW">The Crane Wife</a>, and quickly fell in love with it.  I haven't listened to it much lately, but it got a lot of play in February and March.  Plus, I actually bought the physical CD - isn't that quaint?

<a href="http://www.thenewpornographers.com/">The New Pornographers</a> figured in there prominently as well.

<b>February</b>

I spent the first week of February in the SF Bay area, and while I was there, I picked up <a href="http://www.kaiserchiefs.co.uk">Kaiser Chiefs'</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKH1Q?ie=UTF8&tag=brocklicom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0007TKH1Q">Employment</a> (again, the actual CD!) and listened to it a whole bunch - mostly because I had heard Ruby on <a href="http://www.xmradio.com/onxm/channelpage.xmc?ch=47">Ethel</a> (on the flight there, no less!) and it was stuck in my head all week.  I managed to find that MP3 and listened to it dozens of times while I was there.  A couple weeks later, I got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA276W?ie=UTF8&tag=brocklicom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000NA276W">Yours Truly Angry Mob</a> when it came out, and earlier this month, I got to <a href="http://www.brockli.com/archives/2007/04/kaiser_chiefs_with_the_walkmen.php">see them live</a>.  They've been in rotation since early February.

Around the same time, I heard about <a href="http://www.rautakoura.net/">Rautakoura</a>, the Finnish bluegrass band, thanks to <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/06/17/great_finnish_bluegr.html">Boing Boing</a>.

<b>March</b>

St. Paddy's Day and Shamrockfest were upon us, so <a href="http://www.floggingmolly.com/">Flogging Molly</a> and <a href="http://www.dropkickmurphys.com/">Dropkick Muphys</a> got a lot of action.

<a href="http://www.floggingmolly.com/">Flogging Molly</a> released the Complete Control Sessions EP (only on iTunes, I think), so I got the Float and Requiem for a Dying Song singles.

Later in the month, I got the <a href="http://www.street-dogs.com/">Street Dogs'</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IFRQRW?ie=UTF8&tag=brocklicom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000IFRQRW">Fading American Dream</a> after catching a song or two during their Shamrockfest set.  They're a lot like Dropkick Murphys - no coincidence, really, since the lead singer sang for Dropkick before leaving to be a firemen, before leaving to be a musician again.  Similar musical style, more working-class pro-union liberal lyrics.

<b>April</b>

<a href="http://www.luckyboys.com/">Lucky Boys Confusion</a> made a comeback earlier this month, probably by accident.  I particularly like the song Atari.

<a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/">Jonathon Coulton</a> sauntered in for a while with Code Monkey and Re: Your Brains.

And this week, it's been all about <a href="http://www.arcadefire.com/">Arcade Fire</a>.  Somebody somewhere linked to a <a href="http://www.blogotheque.net/article.php3?id_article=2868">video of them playing in a freight elevator</a>, and I knew I had to have it.  I got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGUZM0?ie=UTF8&tag=brocklicom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000MGUZM0">Neon Bible</a>, listened to it a few times, and began to understand why people had been raving about them for the past couple years.  I did pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IVN9W?ie=UTF8&tag=brocklicom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0002IVN9W">Funeral</a> after that, but I still like Neon Bible better, particularly Black Mirror, Intervention, and above all, No Cars Go.  I feel like I've known them forever.


I've also been on a comedy kick for the past month or two, so <a href="http://www.eddieizzard.com/">Eddie Izzard's</a> Unrepeatable, <a href="http://www.jimgaffigan.com/">Jim Gaffigan's</a> Beyond the Pale, and a <a href="http://www.henryrollins.com/">Henry Rollins</a> album (I can't remember which one) have been repeated far more than such things should be repeated, and excessive quoting has resulted.

So that's most of the music and spoken word I've been listening to.  Sooner or later, I'll get around to posting about the podcasts I've been listening to lately.  Be patient.
