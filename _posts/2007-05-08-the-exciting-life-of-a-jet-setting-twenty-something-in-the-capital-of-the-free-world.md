So check it out, I'm going to San Francisco for two weeks.  I found out at about 9 this evening that I'll be flying out there tomorrow at noon.  Yeah, we don't waste no time round these parts.

I don't really know any specifics yet - right now, I'm more concerned with getting packed and working out the logistics.  For example, I'll be flying back here two days before I move, on the day I was supposed to be picking up keys, and at the tail end of the week that I intended to spend packing and selling off crap I don't need.  Not really sure how all that's going to work out, yet.

Friends in SF, please get in touch so I have your cell number (e-mail and AIM on the <a href="/about.php">About</a> page).  I'll be working normal hours during the week at a client's office, but I'd like to get together with everyone during the two weekends I'll be there for.

I'm pretty psyched.  It won't be as relaxing as <a href="/2007/02/layabout">my last trip there</a>, and I certainly don't have as much time to make plans with people, but it will be a nice change of pace nonetheless.

I really need to start packing.  SF folks, make sure I've got your number, and I'll see you soon.

<b>UPDATE:</b>  Just so we're all on the same page: I am not moving to San Francisco.  I will be there for two weeks for work.  Shortly after returning to the DC area, I'll be moving into a new apartment here.  Sorry for the confusion.
