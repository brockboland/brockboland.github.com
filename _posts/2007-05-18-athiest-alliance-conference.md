Great news, non-believers!  The <a href="http://www.atheistalliance.org/conventions/2007/index.php">Atheist Alliance International Conference</a> is being held in Crystal City - the neighborhood where I live and work - in September!  Granted, I won't live there by then, since I'm moving next weekend, but that's not the point.

The point is that this is wonderful news, because I definitely wouldn't go to it if it would require any travel, but now it's a viable option.  Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens will be there, among others, and it's unlikely that such an event will be so conveniently located in the near future.  I'm not registering yet, but hopefully I'll know soon whether or not I can go.  For you out-of-town folks that are interested, I can house a few people; the place I'm moving into is smaller than my current place, but it's better than paying for a hotel, right?
