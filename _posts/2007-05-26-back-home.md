Barely feels like home, though, since Jym and Mel are mostly moved out.  It sort of feels like my last apartment did just as I started moving in - random crap strewn about, some half-packed boxes, and no clear idea where the dishes are, or if there are dishes.

I've been back less than half an hour, but already I've ordered a pizza, took pictures of a few things I'm trying to sell on Craigslist, packed up some books, and threw out some stuff.  This move has to happen pretty quickly, so I'm going to force myself to part with disposables: that $14 coffee machine I haven't used in four months?  Gone.  Half-empty boxes of cereal?  Gone.  Pretty much any other food I find? Gone.  DVD player I thought I could fix?  Gone.  I need to simplify my material life.
