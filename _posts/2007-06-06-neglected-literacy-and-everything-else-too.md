I need to make more time for books.  So far in 2007, I've only finished seven books, and one of them (the hilarious <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pirates-Adventure-Communists-Novel/dp/0375423974">The Pirates!  In An Adventure With The Communists</a>) only took an afternoon.  I've got two more in the works now, but a quick glance over my book list for the past year and a half shows that my time for reading lately has been woefully inadequate.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I was splayed out on the couch with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everything-Illuminated-Jonathan-Safran-Foer/dp/0141008253/">Everything Is Illuminated</a> or any one of David Sedaris' books, but I read those in my old-old apartment - the one I moved out of last May.  I've read so little since then that they're still relatively fresh in my mind.

I keep hoping that things will calm down soon and I'll have more free time.  I'm back from two weeks in SF, moved into a new apartment, spent this weekend in Buffalo for my buddy Bill's wedding, and I've already spent 35 hours in the office this week.  I've barely touched my news reader since I left for SF almost a month ago, so I've got thousands of blog posts and news items waiting for my attention.  There are still a few boxes I haven't unpacked because I need to get rid of other stuff to make room for them.  I got a USB hard drive to store all my crap, but I haven't even plugged it in yet because there's a monitor (which also needs to go) on the table I'm going to use for my computer, and I haven't had any time to fiddle with it yet anyway.  The MacBook I got last week (which I LOVE, incidentally) has some 80 GB of crap from my old laptop and desktop sitting in the Documents directory, waiting to be sorted and backed up as necessary.  I still haven't really grocery-shopped since I moved over a week ago, except for a quick trip to grab milk, eggs, apples, and some frozen dinners.  I haven't had time for <a href="http://www.sundaynightfilmclub.com/sub/dc//">SNFC</a> - the local chapter I so wanted to start - in a full month, and probably won't this week either.

And, of course, there's about 20 books on my book shelf that were purchased in more leisurely times, when their chances of being read were as high as 1 in 6.  This one especially bugs me because of the money I've invested in my collection and the effort that's gone into moving all of them from apartment to apartment.  That shit's heavy, yo.

My <a href="/archives/2007/03/oof.php">bowling ball/baby/shark</a> situation has surpassed, "Just get through this quarter," and I'm not really sure what comes after that.  Semi-year?  Either way, I just keep chugging along, and hope the train stops before the wheels come off.
