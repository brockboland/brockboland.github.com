In (reverse?) chronological order of viewing, for the past month or so.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844761/">John Waters: This Filthy World</a> - A</b>
I've only seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075936/">Desperate Living</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365125/">A Dirty Shame</a>, so I'm not a Waters purist, but I couldn't believe how entertaining he was in an hour and a half of monologue.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0907657/">Once</a> - B</b>
Equally touching and entertaining, and I loved the music.  Still don't know how I feel about the ending, but I liked it.  Might be showing at a local Landmark or other indie theater.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061747/">Hang 'Em High</a> - D</b>
<a href="http://www.georgetownfilmfest.com/">Georgetown Film Festival</a> is hosting a series of Clint Eastwood films in a couple parks nearby.  Schmitty and I went to see it, and the best part was the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brockli/557971920/">entirely random scaffold-dancing</a> before hand - the movie was slow, and it seems I'm not an Eastwood fan.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469897/">Diggers</a> - B</b>
Less chick-flicky than I expected, and actually pretty entertaining.  I might have a little man-crush on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0748620/">Paul Rudd</a>.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383574/">Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</a> - C</b>
Everyone says it just sets up for the third one and re-uses jokes from the first, and they're right.  Kind of funny, though.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403358/">Night Watch</a> - D</b>
Didn't like the end, but I've never seen subtitles that were well-done in themselves.  That may have been the best part, but the middle bit was OK.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166396/">Waking Ned Devine</a> - C</b>
I really didn't like this as much as I'd hoped I would - seems like it's a modern classic - but it WAS entertaining.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462519/">School for Scoundrels</a> - C</b>
Slightly entertaining, mostly bad.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800328/">The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning</a> - D</b>
The first <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377818/">Dukes</a> movie was a poor representative of the series, and this movie was an abomination of that.  It was a little bit entertaining - a LITTLE bit - but had no bearing whatsoever on the original series.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815456/">Jim Gaffigan: Beyond the Pale</a> - B</b>
Goddamn that guy is hilarious.  I've listened to the album like three times through, and there were some extra bits in the DVD.
