I wasn't going to do anything at all yesterday, because I really just needed a day off to recover.  And I did get to spend most of the day just relaxing, but last night was pretty awesome.

I spent most of my afternoon doing that boring crap I've been putting off - opening a huge pile of mail, copying a bunch of media off the hundreds of CD-Rs I've had lying around for years - then I went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/">Transformers</a>, because I like doing matinees by myself now and then.  It was actually pretty good, but I went into it with incredibly low expectations, so it would have been hard to disappoint me.

After that, I stopped by <a href="http://www.olssons.com/">Olsson's</a>.  Both <a href="http://www.gogolbordello.com/">Gogol Bordello</a> and <a href="http://www.againstme.net/">Against Me!</a> have new albums coming out Tuesday and I wanted to special order them if Olsson's wasn't going to stock them (I like to buy the actual CD for bands I really like, and I'd rather get it from a local chain than Amazon).  They actually had a box full of the Against Me album in back already, but wouldn't give me one till Tuesday (obviously), so I've got one of each on hold.

I've said it before and I'll say it again: the more time I spend hanging out in DC, the more I like it...especially if it's with Schmitty.  I seem to meet at least two or three people every time I hang out with the guy.  Fotios moved back to DC yesterday, so we went to <a href="http://www.scienceclubdc.com/">Science Club</a> for drinks.  I've been there a couple times before and always liked it.  The place is really laid back and they have a big chalkboard by the bar where people write out equations and stuff when they're arguing.  The last time I was there was a Wednesday, so it was pretty quiet.  No one checked my ID at the front gate, on the way into their patio, so I assumed that the guy standing at the door with a book and a cigarette was the bouncer.  Turns out, he had just stepped out for a smoke; he spent the evening sitting at the bar, reading about philosophy.  It's that kind of place.

So we had a good time hanging out, and later learned that more people we knew were upstairs for Compton's birthday.  We got to talking with a guy and girl that work there and found out both of them had seen Against Me! and the chick had seen Gogol Bordello (this was after I'd convinced the guy to get tickets for their show next week).  In the past two weeks, I've met a half dozen people that know one or the other - until recently, no one seemed to know who they were.  Maybe I've just been meeting the wrong people.

I got home around 4:30 and slept till 2.  In a few hours, I'm heading down to Chinatown to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/">Live Free or Die Hard</a> with the <a href="http://www.sundaynightfilmclub.com/sub/dc/">Film Club</a>.  A pretty nice weekend, I'd say.
