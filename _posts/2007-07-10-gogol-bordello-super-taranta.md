Just finished my first listen-through of <a href="http://www.gogolbordello.com/">Gogol Bordello</a>'s Super Taranta, and it is FUCKING AWESOME.  I also got the new albums from <a href="http://www.againstme.net/">Against Me!<a> and <a href="http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/">Smashing Pumpkins</a> (who did a show tonight in DC - waiting for my roommate to get home and report on that), but I haven't really had a chance to listen to those two yet.  More soon.
