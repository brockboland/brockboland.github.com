It's been a banner week here at the BrockLi headquarters.  Got in a couple movies screenings, two concerts, and went out with friends almost every night.

On Monday, Schmitty, Fotios, Mace and I saw the screening of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787475/">Hot Rod</a>.  I can't even describe how hilarious and random it was - I loved it, but you definitely need to go in expecting <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247745/">Super Trooper</a>-style humor.

Tuesday night was a screening of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0829482/">Superbad</a>.  Mace and I loved it, Kidder and his friend hated it.  Again, you need to appreciate that kind of humor - it's definitely a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0031976/">Judd Apatow</a> flick.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0148418/">Michael Cera</a> is hilarious and I've always loved <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0736622/">Seth Rogen</a>

Wednesday night was the <a href="http://www.gogolbordello.com/">Gogol Bordello</a> show at <a href="http://www.930.com/">9:30</a>, which was just as awesome as you would expect it to be.  They did all the best songs from the new album and a bunch of my favorites from Gypsy Punks Underdog World Strike.  As always, their performance was entirely over the top.  I left during a drawn-out marathon version of Baro Faro - I was too beat and dehydrated to handle any more - but apparently they did Mala Vida after that.  NPR broadcast the show live, and you can listen to it <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11907007">on their site</a>.

Thursday night, I finally got to use my iSight to chat with Ryan and Sarah for a bit.  Fonny and Molly were in Columbia for a wedding this weekend, so we did dinner and drinks Friday night with a bunch of other folks.  And last night, my roommate's friend's band was playing at the <a href="http://www.rnrdc.com/">RnR Bar & Lounge</a>.  I hate to say it, but they weren't very good.  But, I had a good time hanging out with new people.  Today, the <a href="http://www.sundaynightfilmclub.com/sub/dc/">Film Club</a> went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0832903/">Manufactured Landscapes</a>, which was incredibly disappointing.  It was an interesting topic, but terribly presented and pretty boring.

This week should be a little quieter.  Thursday night is the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theswellseason">Swell Season</a> show, also at 9:30, and that's about it.  Fine by me - I could use a week off.
