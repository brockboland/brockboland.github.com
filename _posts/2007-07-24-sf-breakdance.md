Apparently San Francisco <a href="http://sfist.com/2007/07/24/power_outages.php">has been having some power troubles</a>, which means that I can't use <a href="http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a> or search <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a>.  Strangely enough, the search seems to be the only thing wrong with Yelp right now: I can navigate around just fine, but I can't find new stuff.  I rarely use either site, and now that I want both of them I get neither.
