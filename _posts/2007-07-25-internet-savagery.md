For the second time this week, I'm wreaking havoc on my subscriptions in <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a>, because ya know what?  I don't need this much news, nor the guilt I feel for never reading it.  Even so, I feel just a little guilty every time I removed a blog, even though I don't know any of the authors and rarely even read their posts.

I'm down to around 130 feeds now.  I know that sounds ridiculous, until I tell you that I cut about 60 earlier this week, and 20 more since I started writing this post.  A lot of the remaining 130 don't update regularly - probably 20 are friends that don't blog much, and another 30 are other low-post feeds.  I can't believe that six months ago, I managed to keep up on so many of them.  No wonder I didn't go out much.

And as long as we're talking productivity, I FINALLY started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0142000280%26tag=ws%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0142000280%253FSubscriptionId=0782RYY3QEFRPDXVN402">Getting Things Done</a> this week.  I've been reading it on the Metro, so I'm only about 50 pages in, but already I'm feeling a lot more relaxed - knowing that I'm at least taking some initiative to sort out this mess has reduced my stress level a fair bit.  Cleaning out my feed reader is step one - I know very little about the GTD system at this point, but I think that getting rid of all that unnecessary distraction will help.

And as long as we're talking books, I also started <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0618680004%26tag=ws%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0618680004%253FSubscriptionId=0782RYY3QEFRPDXVN402">The God Delusion</a> last week, and I'm liking it a lot more than I thought I would.  Richard Dawkins has always seems kind of dry, and...well, BRITISH, so I was worried it would be boring, but he keeps a pretty good pace.  It's another book I've been meaning to read for a long time and finally got around to starting.

And as long as we're talking about God, I feel I should mention that we decided on Friday that "God" shall henceforth be known as "g√∂d" (pronounced sort of like "gurd," for those of you that don't speak German).  Just so you all know.
