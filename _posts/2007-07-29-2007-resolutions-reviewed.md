<p>Holy crap, July's almost over already!  Wouldn't you agree that this is a good time to review our resolutions for the year?  I'll start:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Go to the gym:</b>  This one hasn't gone that well.  I did pretty good in March and April, but it fell apart when I went to SF in May and they closed the gym at the hotel, and then I moved when I got back and just fell out of the routine.  But, I went down there yesterday and today, and I'm hoping to get it back into my routine this week.</li>
<li><b>Spend less time just hanging out in the apartment:</b>  Since moving into the city, I've been going out way more than I ever used to.  Check!</li>
<li><b>Get a handle on my finances:</b>  Going OK.</li>
<li><b>Be more positive about life in general:</b>  Ehhhh.  So-so.</li>
<li><b>Try brewing beer:</b>  Not yet.  Like a novelist investigating their topic, I've spent a lot of time drinking beer.</li>
<li><b>Do more personal projects:</b>  Haven't had time, but I've got some ideas.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, could be better.  How's your list been going?</p>
