I kind of like coming into the office on Saturday.  There's no one else around (although Terrence is here with me today), and no clients are working, so I can keep working without being interrupted every ten minutes.

Of course, that brings a new problem - my eyes aren't used to staring at a monitor for uninterrupted hours on end, and I tend to a headache if I don't get up to wander around once in a while.  Plus, it's Saturday, and I should really be doing any number of other things.
