I feel like I've been a few paces behind for the past five months.  I'm behind on the magazines stacked on my headboard, behind on the thousands of news items in my RSS reader, behind on the dozens of posts I have wanted to write here, behind on keeping up with friends both out of town and in, behind on e-mails that have sat in my inbox for months awaiting response.  About the only thing I've managed to keep up on is paying the bills, and sometimes just barely.

I realized that I've been in my "new" apartment for a couple weeks shy of six months now.  I look back on things that happened, conversations I had, and can't believe how long ago they took place.  The past five months were a frenzied blur; I was so busy with work, and then so occuppied with a new relationship, that everything else was just put on hold.  For a while there, BP was coming down to visit practically every month; I don't think I've seen him since I drove up to Buffalo for Bill's wedding back in June.  And speaking of Bill, I don't think I've even spoken to him since I called a month after the wedding to ask about married life.  Too many things took a back burner for too long, and I regret that.

Everything was pushed aside because of a major project at work - the biggest I've ever been involved in - that dominated my time and caused me unbelievable stress for a few months there.  Sometime around late August, it calmed down a little bit, but was still a challenge.  About the same time, I started spending a lot of time with Erin, so that contributed to it.  That part, I certainly don't regret; I mention it because it was easy for our relationship to fill what little room had been given up by work, and the cycle continued.

The project that caused so much distress ended November 1, and things were supposed to be smooth sailing after that.  Erin and I spent the first week of the month in the San Francisco Bay area on vacation, which was fantastic, and then I attended the DC-PHP conference and spent a weekend visiting Erin's sister in Raleigh.  When I finally got back to the office, November was nearly halfway over and things were still a little hectic.  I spent so long looking forward to the end of that project that I almost expected that everything would be cupcakes and puppies once it was over.  I mean, there's obviously still work to be done, but I really thought we'd be able to have some down time for a month or two to recover from the six months we had spent busting ass, but no such luck - yet.

At any rate, I feel like I need a few weeks off from everything to recuperate and catch up on everything.  We spent this weekend doing almost absolutely nothing.  It was wonderful and relaxing, but not nearly long enough, and I didn't do any reading or writing or anything, so I did a lot more of the recuperating than the catch-upping.  I'm hoping to have a little more downtime over the coming weeks to spend on my own stuff.  If nothing else, Erin is going home for almost a week for Thanksgiving, so that will give me a chance to catch up with local friends I haven't seen much of and maybe do some reading.

Or maybe I'll just lie around for a few more days.  That's been pretty nice, and it's been so long since I've been able to get away with it that I almost want to do it as long as I can.
