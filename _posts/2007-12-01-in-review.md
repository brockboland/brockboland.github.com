A bunch of things happened in the past few months that I never really got a chance to mention here.  Let's have us a quick recap, eh? (More or less in chronological order)

<b>Atheist Alliance International Conference</b>, in Crystal City
So, a lot of atheists - the kind that would go to the conference, anyway - are WAY more involved than I am.  I met a few group organizers and a number of people that are involved politically, and the crowd was generally older than I would have expected - I'd say that less than 10% were under 30 (granted, not a lot of 20-somethings have money to travel to DC for a conference).  I'm really glad I went - it was enlightening, I learned a lot, heard some interesting opinions, and got some good argument points in a couple sessions.  Well worth the money.

<b>Matt Pond PA</b>, at 930 Club
I didn't know any of their songs when we went, but Erin wanted to see them.  It was a cool show, but really not the kind of band I would see by myself.

<b>Street Dogs</b>, opening for Tiger Army at Black Cat
One of the best punk shows I've been to.  Honestly, even better than expected.  I think my favorite part was when they started playing Fatty and all the big fellas pushed their way up front.  We didn't stick around for Tiger Army.

<b>Gogol Bordello</b>, at Sonar in Baltimore
Gogol never disappoints.  Fun as always.

<b>Against Me!</b>, at 930 Club
The songs from their new album, New Wave, went over better than I figured they would.  I really like most of them, but they're not really the kind you would dance and sing to at a concert, I thought.  We hung out near the back and I just sang my little heart out - I'm gettin too old to keep getting punched in the chest in the pit, so I didn't even both jumping in for this one.  Sometimes, it's nice to just stand back and enjoy the band.
