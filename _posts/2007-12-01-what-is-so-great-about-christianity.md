I'm starting to think I may have bought the wrong book.  I mean, I don't think there were any elections for it or anything, but is <a href="http://www.dineshdsouza.com/">Dinesh D'Souza</a> the spokesman for Christians?  I just started chapter seven of <i>What's So Great About Christianity?</i>  It begins on page 67, which should give you some sense of the depth with which D'Souza explores his arguments.

By the time I got through the first chapter, I had made several notes in the margins and on an index card.  My plan was to collect my notes and counter-arguments, cite other authors' arguments where appropriate, and compile it into a sort of supplemental to give to my parents at Christmas - a "this is what I believe and why" package.

It became clear, around chapter three, that I was going to have a ton of writing to do if I wanted to adequately address his flimsy and largely unfounded arguments.  I haven't been taking as many notes since, because really, what's the point?  Here's your reading supplemental: read <i>The God Delusion</i> first, and <i>What's So Great About Christianity?</i> will seem absolutely absurd in comparison.

I may post my comments after each of the eight parts of the book, if there's anything worth mentioning.  Like I said in my <a href="/archives/2007/11/whats_so_great_about_christian.php">original post about it</a>, I'm trying to keep an open mind and give the other side their say, but it's really hard to take any of I seriously.  Nonetheless, I soldier on, reading inane crap so you don't have to.  I'll keep you posted.
