I had a rough weekend and a shitty morning. My "just make it to January" mantra seems too much like the <a href="/archives/2007/03/oof.php">ones I had earlier this year</a>, and that worries me, because that turned into "just make it though six or eight months."  But, seriously this time, I think everything will be OK if I can just get through two moves and Christmas.
