I finally got around to reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" target="_blank">Getting Things Done</a>.  I first tried to implement it during that month or two we were incredibly busy at work, so it didn't really take - at least partly because I never did a full mind-dump to get everything in the system to begin with.

A couple weeks ago, I started playing with <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/" target="_blank">OmniFocus</a>, and decided to give GTD another go.  Since then, I've gotten pretty good about putting stuff in.

The problem is getting stuff out.  I still haven't gotten into the habit of checking OmniFocus when I've got free time to see what I should be doing.  I feel like everything in OmniFocus is still in my head - I have some free time and think, "I don't feel like doing any of that stuff," because I know what stuff is in there.  I need to get in the habit of checking it on a regular basis, so I can just put all my to-do's into it and forget about them.

If anyone has any advice or suggestions on forming that habit, <a href="mailto:brock@brockboland.com">let me know</a>.
