I'm in the process of upgrading <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" target="_blank">Movable Type</a>, so things may be a little wonky for the next couple days.  It was time for some spring cleaning, so I did a fresh install.  I think MT is all set, and all my old posts are here, but I've still got some more content to move over from the old site - stuff like my Projects and Portfolio pages, the About Me page, that kind of stuff.

That, and in MT4, entry URLs use dashes for spaces instead of underscores.  I have links to my own posts in the format "whats_so_great_about_christianity.php", but if you actually go to that post, the URL is "whats-so-great-about-christianity.php".  I'm assuming that's a setting I just haven't found yet, but until I do, links within new posts to old posts will be broken.

If you find any gaping holes, please <a href="mailto:brock@brockli.com">drop me a note</a>.
