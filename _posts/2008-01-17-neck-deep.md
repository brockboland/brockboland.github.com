Have you ever had one of those mornings where you're thirsty, hungry, and you have to pee, but you're too busy working on something and don't want to lose track of what you're doing so you don't get up to deal with that kind of stuff?

That's how my morning has been so far.  Sometimes, it's really satisfying, because you keep doing that "just five more minutes, bladder" thing, and then - hurrah! - you finish whatever it is you're working on, hit the head, and grab another Coke.  Other times, you find a bug, and know that it won't be finished before your bladder explodes.

Sure is nice to stop and take a leak though, isn't it?
