People sometimes refer to <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43Folders</a> and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> as productivity porn, but today I found something on Lifehacker that's much more exciting to me: <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/go-bag/">man purse porn</a>.  They call it a Go Bag, but we're talking about the same thing: the bag of crap you take with you everywhere (except, they don't specify that it's for men).  I'm pretty sure that "be prepared" is the only thing I took away from being a Boy Scout, because I like having a lot of stuff handy.

The messenger bag I've been using for the past 4+ years has almost completely fallen apart, so I've spent months obsessing about finding a suitable replacement.  As it turns out, I'm pretty particular about my man purse; I bought this one from American Eagle's website and completely lucked out, and now that I've known man-purse-perfection, I don't think I can ever look back.  In fact, I'd buy the same one again, but they seem to have discontinued it.

I've been poking through their galleries, looking for bags that might work for me.  It needs to be big enough for my MacBook, a couple books, and some other stuff, but I don't want it to be TOO big; I need the Goldilocks bag.

I'm a picky bitch.  If you've got a bag you love, <a href="mailto:brock@brockboland.com">let me know</a> so I can check it out.
