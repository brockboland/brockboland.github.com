Once upon a time, JR recommended that I write a script to pull comments from my blog's syndicated account on LiveJournal into Movable Type, so that all comments would appear in one place.

And I did, and all was well for a while, but the recent upgrade broke it.

Well, it's fixed now.  Not a big deal, really, but all comments will be copied here every now and again when I run the script and approve them.  Futhermore, you LJ folks can now comment on my actual site with your LiveJournal account.  If you'd rather do that, click the link at the top of the post in LJ, and use the Sign In link below comments that have already been made.  LiveJournal is one of the options on the right side.

Or, just comment on LJ.  Either way, I'm stealin ur thoughtz.
