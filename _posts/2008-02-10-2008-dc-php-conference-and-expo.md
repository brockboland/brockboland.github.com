<form mt:asset-id="2" class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="DC-PHP 2008 Logo" src="/files/images/dcphp2008.jpg" width="186" height="134" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></form>

This year's <a href="http://www.dcphpconference.com/">DC PHP Conference & Expo</a> is going to come earlier than last year's: June 2-4, rather than in November.  I'm hoping to go again, because it was pretty interesting and informative last time, and I'm sure this one will be even better.  If you're a web developer in (or near) DC, consider <a href="https://www.kbconferences.com/registration/dcphp08/">registering</a> - or, better yet, <a href="http://www.dcphpconference.com/node/346">submit a paper</a>!
