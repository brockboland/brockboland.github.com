PZ Meyers was kicked out of a screening of Ben Stein's new "documentary," <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091617/">Expelled</a>.

<blockquote>I went to attend a screening of the creationist propaganda movie, Expelled, a few minutes ago. Well, I tried ... but I was Expelled! It was kind of weird -- I was standing in line, hadn't even gotten to the point where I had to sign in and show ID, and a policeman pulled me out of line and told me I could not go in. I asked why, of course, and he said that a producer of the film had specifically instructed him that I was not to be allowed to attend. The officer also told me that if I tried to go in, I would be arrested. I assured him that I wasn't going to cause any trouble.</blockquote>

But who DID get in?  Richard Dawkins.  <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/expelled.php">Read the whole story</a> and <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/a_late_night_quick_one.php">the follow up</a>.
