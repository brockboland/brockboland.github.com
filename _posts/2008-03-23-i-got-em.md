Last Friday, I stopped at the jeweler on my way home from work to pick up Erin's just-resized engagement ring.  When I got back to our building, I had a bouquet of flowers in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other.  A guy about my age got in the elevator with me, and out of the corner of my eye, I could see him looking me up and down.

He said, "Looks like you're going to make somebody happy tonight."

"You don't know the half of it - the ring's in this pocket," I replied, pointing to the bulge in my pants pocket.

"Are you serious?!  Well, go get 'em buddy!"

And I did go get 'em.  I thought it was pretty funny, and I finally remembered to tell Erin about it tonight.
