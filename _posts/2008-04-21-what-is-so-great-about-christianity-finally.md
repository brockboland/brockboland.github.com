<a href="/2007/12/what_is_so_great_about_christi.php">Way back in December</a>, I was reading Dinesh D'Souza's <i>What's So Great About Christianity?</i> and trying to keep an open mind about it.  Which was tough, because it was pretty awful.

Around Christmas, I finished writing up my notes and rebuttals, but never really got around to polishing it up and citing better references and what have you.  After four months, I've decided that I probably never will, so I'm just posting what I wrote then:
