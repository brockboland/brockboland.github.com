I've had this site on WordPress for a few days now, after using Movable Type for over three years.

So far, I love it.

I don't want to place blame, but for the past couple months, Movable Type was giving me hell.  I kept getting 500 Internal Server Errors on almost every other page load, and I don't know if it was because of MT, 1&1 (my web host), or because my 650+ posts were too much for the system.  According to the Google, a lot of other people were having this problem - long run times seemed to be the issue - but no one seemed to have any solutions.  It was incredibly frustrating to do anything, and so I just avoided it.

Under those circumstances, MT was kind of like a rusted-out Oldsmobile that only fired on three cylinders and refused to start on cold mornings.  In comparison, WordPress is like a brand new Vespa - quick, sleek, and kind of fun.  And most importantly, it doesn't stall in the middle of the highway.

Now that I think about it, maybe it was because of the language. Movable Type is mostly Perl, and WordPress is PHP.  I don't know enough about Perl to know if that could have been an issue, but whatever.  I'm a big fan of Movable Type, but it just wasn't working for me.  I got all my posts and comments moved over, the permalinks seem to be alright, and I'm happy.  I need to get my portfolio and project pages fixed up, but on the whole, the migration was easier and quicker than I thought it would be.

Of course, as I was editing this, brockli.com disappeared entirely for half an hour, then gave me a 500 error, then refused to connect to the database for a little while.  Maybe I can blame 1&1 after all.
