Most of the text I edit is code.  It's just part of being a web developer.  Sure, I do a little writing now and again for this here blog, but I usually do that in a web browser, so most of the time I spend in text editors is for code.  But, I'm working on a pretty big documentation project for work, and I'm trying out [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for blog posts, so I'm spending more time in a plain vanilla text editor to do both.

These are the text editors I've come to know and love.

Notepad
-------
Everybody starts with Notepad.  I think I wrote all of my HTML and fledgling Javascript in Notepad back in high school - Dreamweaver just felt unwieldy, and I didn't know about any other options at the time.

UltraEdit
---------
It's been a long time since I've used [UltraEdit](http://www.ultraedit.com/), but it was my go-to editor for most of college.  I really only used it because I could open several files in tabs - pretty standard these days, but that was the first time I'd seen it.  I don't even know what else it was capable of, because I just used it as a basic text editor.

Zend Studio
-----------
[Zend Studio](http://www.zend.com/en/products/studio/) has been my primary IDE since I started my current job two and a half years ago.  I love it because of the code completion and debugging for PHP, but I wind up using it for just about any text I need to edit quickly while I'm working because it's always open.  I also use it on my MacBook if I'm doing stuff for work.

TextMate
--------
[TextMate](http://macromates.com/) has been gaining ground in my workflow.  It's a pretty powerful little editor, but I barely take advantage of it.  I use it all the time to edit plain text, but I almost never code in it - Zend is a far superior IDE for PHP, so it never made sense to use TextMate for it.

The real power in TextMate comes from its bundles.  I just finished a project with [Code Igniter](http://codeigniter.com/) (more on that in another post soon), and TextMate turned out to be a lot more useful thanks to the [Code Igniter TextMate Bundle](http://www.sellersrank.com/codeigniter-textmate-bundle-download/) (for the record, I found a [second bundle](http://benmcredmond.com/citm/) when trying to find the link to that one, but I haven't tried it yet).  I like Zend's code completion, but I was able to develop in TextMate a lot quicker with the shortcuts provided by the bundle.

It also has a Markdown bundle, which adds some keyboard shortcuts, provides a quick cheat sheet, and makes it easy to preview while you're writing.  In fact, I'm writing this in TextMate right now.

**Update**: I love it even more now that I've watched [this video about blogging in TextMate](http://macromates.com/screencast/blogging_take_two.mov).  You can post new entries and edit existing ones right in TextMate!

WriteRoom
---------
To be honest, I haven't actually written anything in [WriteRoom](http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom), except for the couple of times I've played with it to tweak the font and such.  Basically, it gives you a solid black screen with a narrow column of simple green text and a blinking console cursor.  The colors can be customized, of course, but the point is that it gives you a stripped down, no frills, typewriter-like interface where you can write without the distraction of menus, bouncing dock icons, or IM windows.  It really makes me *wish* I had something to write, because it just compels me to spill everything into words on the screen.  I thought I might start using it with Markdown to write blog posts and stuff, but that was before I found all the shortcuts in TextMate.  Still, WriteRoom just begs to be used, and I wish I had more than two days left in my trial so I could see if I can't find a use for it.
