Please don't vote for McCain.  Unless you're over 60, you have no excuse.  McCain is older than <a href="http://www.thingsyoungerthanmccain.com/">the Golden Gate Bridge, chocolate chip cookies, Alaska, and Bugs Bunny</a>.  Is that ageism?  Maybe, but I don't think it's too much to expect a president to survive his term.  And come on, the world is changing faster and faster every day - we need someone that can keep up and has a chance of understanding the technology that drives it.  If a president has to be over 35, I don't think it's unreasonable to say they should be under 70, too.

Vote for Barack Obama.  You know, unless you hate America.
