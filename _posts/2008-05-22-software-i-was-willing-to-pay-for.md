At some point in our lives - let's call it "college" - many of us downloaded illegal copies of software because we didn't have the money to purchase it, or because we needed the money for something else - let's call it "beer."  Not that I would do such a thing, of course.

Now that I'm not flat broke, I'm more willing to pay for well-designed software that I find useful, and much less likely to spend a lot of time trying to find and figure out flaky free alternatives, or consider "other" means of acquisition.  These are some of the Mac apps that have been deemed worthy of my purchase lately.

[AppZapper](http://www.appzapper.com/)
---------
Uninstalling applications on a Mac usually just means dragging them to the trash.  It's a simple method, though incredibly difficult for PC users to get used to.  However, not all applications can be removed so easily.  Sometimes, configuration files lurk in your Library or elsewhere.  Furthermore, it can be hard to get rid of things like plugins and widgets if you don't know where to look.

[AppZapper](http://www.appzapper.com/) fills this hole - it's the "uninstaller Apple forgot."  It's true that Apple should have just included this functionality in the OS, but since they didn't, AppZapper is definitely worth the $12.95.

[Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/)
--------
It seems like there should be at least one free FTP client for the Mac that doesn't suck, but since I haven't found it, [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/) was worth $29.95.  After the 15 day free trial, you don't get to use favorites and it limits your session to 10 minutes.  For months, I resisted the price tag.  I assumed that there simply had to be a good free alternative out there, and any FTP'ing I had to do was done in 10-minute increments in Transmit.  I don't know why I held out for so long, because Transmit is a great product, and the developers deserve to get paid for it.

[TextMate](http://macromates.com/)
--------
This isn't a new purchase (I've had it for about a year), but [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) has become more and more useful to me lately.  I wrote a [post about it a couple days ago](http://www.brockli.com/2008/05/the-editors-i-have-known-and-loved.php).  It was a little cheaper when I bought it, and $64 seems pretty steep for a text editor, but it meets needs I didn't even know I had.

[OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/)
---------
[OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/) is the kind of thing that I should really use more than I do.  It's a fantastic [GTD](http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php)-style task management app, but it would be a lot more valuable to me if I could just get in the habit of using it to track things I need to do.  I've made a few well-intentioned attempts at my own GTD system, but I always seem to put a bunch of "I should do this eventually" type stuff into my system (in this case, OmniFocus), and then I never want to open it because I'll be faced with all this crap that I need to get done, so I just keep making little post-it notes and ad-hoc lists and things still fall through the cracks.  It took me about a dozen tries to quit smoking - maybe it will take me a dozen more to start using OmniFocus.
