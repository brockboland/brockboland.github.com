![Fonny: Microblogging!](/files/uploads/2008/05/fonny-microblogging.png)

After a long Twitter hiatus, Fonny returned to [MICROBLOGGING](http://twitter.com/Wasyl/statuses/811053050), and we got to talking about it online.

<span style="color:red;">Fonny:</span> I think Twitter is a little silly personally

<span style="color:red;">Fonny:</span> I'm making fun of my friend who told me that lately he's been "getting into microblogging"

<span style="color:blue;">Brock:</span> that's like saying concerts are a little silly because you don't like boy bands

It reminds me of that line in [Team America: World Police](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372588/) about "use your acting," as if "acting" was the solution.  A few years ago, people were going on and on about how "blogging" can give your company a good image, and be used for personal branding, and will groom your dog.  Now, microblogging will solve everything!  And widgets!  WEB TWO POINT OH!

I don't want to name names, but some people I've seen around the Internets seem to attribute a lot of power to reasonably abstract concepts.  "Blogging" isn't a thing anyone can really pin down, because it means different things to different people.  It's not a solution, or a problem, or anything specific even - a blog is a means of delivering content, and anyone that tries to give it a more specific or meaningful definition probably doesn't understand it as well as they think they do, or at least works in marketing.

It drives me nuts when I hear people say things like "blogs are stupid," because it's so generic.  I think the concert analogy I made to Fonny makes sense: one would sound pretty stupid if they dismissed concerts altogether because they didn't like a particular band that's playing.  Fine, you don't like the band, but that doesn't invalidate the idea of public performance.  It's the same thing with blogs.  Fine, maybe you don't like the way [Heather Armstrong](http://www.dooce.com/) writes about her life, but that doesn't mean blogs are worthless - it means you shouldn't bother reading dooce.  There's a ton of really good stuff being put out there everyday, and I hate to see people dismiss it all because they've only managed to find the crappy parts.  The same thing goes for Twitter: there's a lot of crap, but that doesn't make the service or the concept inherently worthless.

Anyway, Fonny and I had a nice chat about it, and I don't mean to imply that he's one of the people doing this.  He just got me thinking about it, and I wanted to include him because really, and how can you not love that face!
