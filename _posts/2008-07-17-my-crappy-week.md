[Phone Fumble '08](http://www.brockli.com/2008/07/my-poor-iphone.php) is turning into a real kick in the crotch.  More glass has fallen out of the screen, but it still works OK.  I had hoped that prices of used iPhones would drop on Craigslist, but if anything, they've gone up - the cheapest ones have gone from $200ish to about $350, and there are still a ton of want ads on there.  That may be the worst part - I could have turned a profit on the damn thing if I could have kept it off the sidewalk.

It would cost me $200 to cancel my iPhone plan contract and go back to a boring regular phone, and at that price, I may as well just get a new one.  Then I find out that 3G is sold out pretty much everywhere, and then I walked home in the rain.

Add all that to the carnival of incompetence on display in the DC bureaucracy throughout the course of [changing my name](http://www.brockli.com/2008/07/hi-my-name-is-brock.php), and some other unpleasantness, and it's been a crappy week.  At this point, I'm really just looking forward to getting out of town for a few days for the [Doherty/Friedlander union](http://wedding.rsdoherty.com/) next weekend.
