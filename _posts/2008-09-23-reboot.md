Every now and then, <a href="/2008/05/chore-blogging">I neglect my blog for a few months</a>. It's not for lack of interest, or lack of things to write about; I just don't have any time for a little while, and then when I have something quick I'd like to post about, I feel like I'm doing a disservice by not making time to write meaningful posts about the stuff I wanted to post about, either for my own selfish reasons or because it may legitimately be useful to someone else who is looking for information I've found or has a question that I can answer.

And so, every once in a while, I have to convince myself to put all that behind me, accept the fact that it won't get written and that's okay, and start posting again, even if it's short and meaningless and inane. Like this.
