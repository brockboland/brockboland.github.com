Just about three years ago, I wrote [Information Overload](http://www.brockli.com/2005/10/information-overload.php).

I'm trying to decide if I feel the complete opposite or exactly the same.  I don't bother trying to keep up on everything any more - I've learned to accept that I can't - though I do still consume a lot.  I find that I get restless and bored quickly if I don't have something to watch, something to read, or something to do.  Like Against Me! said in [Don't Lose Touch](http://www.againstme.net/am.php/disco/track_detail/track_13_dont_lose_touch):
> Constant entertainment for our restless minds.
>
> Constant stimulation for epic appetites.

That's pretty much what I've come to expect.  There is almost no time that I don't start to feel a little antsy if I have nothing to do for more than a couple minutes.  I need a book, or a magazine, or [RSS feeds on my iPhone](http://www.phantomfish.com/byline.html), or at least a new podcast.  It doesn't matter what I'm doing: riding the train, waiting on hold, waiting for a file to download, sitting in a conference call about something I'm not involved in, even walking home - I feel like I need constant input.  There's so much out there, so much entertainment and information, that I feel like I'm just wasting cycles if I'm not accepting some kind of input.  Sometimes I'll even be watching a show I really like on TV, and I'll fire up Google Reader because it's just not quite entertaining enough.

You know, now that I actually put all that into words, I have to imagine it would qualify as Internet Anxiety Disorder.  But how can you **not** want to take it all in?
