I just realized, pretty much just now, that I really don't want to get a desktop.  I got rid of my last one about a year ago, and I always sort of figured I would get an iMac once I had somewhere to put it.

What do I want with another computer, though?  I don't need more synchronization and backup headaches.  An iMac won't do anything for me that my MacBook can't do.  What I really need is a nice keyboard, mouse, and monitor that I can hook the MacBook up to when I'm at home.  Well, what I **really** need is an apartment with a second bedroom so we can have an office.  Right now, we do most of our computing at the kitchen table, and most of our eating at the coffee table.  I can start thinking about upgrades once I have somewhere to put them.
