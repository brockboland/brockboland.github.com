If you're not a member of [tourfilter](http://www.tourfilter.com/), you probably should be: list all the bands you want to see live, and they'll e-mail you when they're coming to town.  Just make sure you sign up in the right city, because I got e-mails about shows in Boston for weeks before I figured out what was going on.

I mention this because several weeks ago - well, closer to two months ago, now that I think about it - I got an e-mail notifying me that two of my favorite bands would be in town soon.  And lo and behold, Ted Leo and the Pharmacists are opening for Against Me at [Black Cat](http://www.blackcatdc.com/) on October 8!

Tickets for that have sold out (sorry, I meant to post about this weeks ago), but you should still sign up with [tourfilter](http://www.tourfilter.com/).  It's a hell of a lot easier than checking every band's website every couple months.
