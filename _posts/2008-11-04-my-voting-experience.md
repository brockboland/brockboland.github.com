The polls in DC open at 7 AM, so I got to the polling place at about 5:45 to make sure I could get through there quickly and get into work.  There were already about 15 people there, including a few on lawn chairs or folding stools.  By the time the doors opened, there were probably about 300 people behind me.

The voting part only took about 15 minutes.  DC uses paper ballots with a scanner machine, so it was a lot less eventful than the big curtained booths I remember my parents voting in when I was a kid (you know, the ones with the big KA-CHUNK levers).

I probably could have voted three times if I really wanted to.  My dad told me a couple weeks ago that I got some things about voting in the mail at their house, and I was on the voter roll today twice, as both Randy and Brock.  I kind of figured NY would un-register me when I registered in DC, and I DEFINITELY thought DC would just change my registration when I changed my name, but apparently they make it pretty easy to commit voter fraud.

And now we wait and hope and pray that we, as a country, have smartened up a bit since 2004.  I think I'll spend the rest of my lunch break researching Canadian citizenship just in case.
