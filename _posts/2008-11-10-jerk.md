My dad had knee surgery on Thursday.  I talked to him last night to see how we was doing and catch up a bit.

Dad: Oh yeah, I think you're rubbing off on me a bit.

Me: Oh really?

Dad: Yeah, the other day, Mom lost a file she made on the computer, and I managed to find it for her.

Me: Oh, I was hoping you would say that you'd been feeling more liberal since the surgery or something like that.

Dad: Nope, they didn't do anything to my brain.

Me: Walked right into that one, didn't I.
