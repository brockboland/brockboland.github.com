I would sum up [Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280?ie=UTF8&tag=brocklicom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0142000280) in two points:

1. Write everything down.
2. Everything is work.

The first is the most important for actually getting stuff done.  [As I've said before](/2008/09/omnifocus-vs-things.php), if it doesn’t get written down, it doesn’t happen.

The second thing may not have actually been a point in the book, now that I think about it, but I've started seeing everything that needs to get done as a piece of work: I have to take out the trash and do laundry and book a hotel for that one weekend and make a shopping list and send an old friend an e-mail and research an API for a project I want to do.  To me, things don't fall into categories like household chores or personal projects - everything is a task that needs to be processed at some point.  It's not "work" in the traditional sense of the term, but they are things that need to be worked on.

I used to get so stressed about all the stuff on my todo list that wasn't getting done, but now I realize that there will **always** be more stuff on my todo list.  It all needs to get done, sooner or later.  As long as I just keep chugging along, as long as I keep being productive, I will be content.  I no longer get worried about all the things that need to get done, but I do get anxious if I feel like I've been slacking off and haven't at least accomplished *something* every day.
