I really wish I had more time to write.  Well, I really wish I had more time for a lot of things, but I've got a lot going on these days that has been keeping me busy:
<ul>
	<li>Work has been busy</li>
	<li>I've been doing volunteer work on a local homeless shelter's website through the <a href="http://www.taprootfoundation.org/">Taproot Foundation</a></li>
	<li>Erin and I are moving again in a few weeks - only a few blocks, but to a nicer place that allows dogs - so we're trying to figure out what we can get rid of and make plans for the move</li>
	<li>We're renting out our current place for Inauguration</li>
	<li>Holiday travel, of course</li>
	<li>Erin and I are spending the long Valentine's Day weekend in the Smoky Mountains</li>
</ul>

There's just a lot going on.  Things should quiet down a bit after January, when we're completely done moving and the homeless shelter project wraps up, but that feels a long way off right now.
