I've been fighting off some respiratory unpleasantness the past few days, so I'm working from home today.  It reminds me a lot of those long nights in college - it's kind of chilly in here, the shades are drawn and lights are dim, I've got music playing in my headphones, no one else is around, and I'm coding away.  Some of my fondest memories of college are from the nights I spent plugging along on some project, finally crashing sometime early in the morning with the satisfaction of a job well done.  I miss those smoke breaks in the frigid Rochester night air, watching the snow plows clear the lots outside my apartment.

It's weird, the things that really stand out in my memory three years later.
