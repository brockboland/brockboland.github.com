I'm not sure I really get people that believe the Bible is the word of God.
<blockquote>This is the word of God!  This is the highest book in all the land!  It is the literal word of God, and every word is sacred!  Well, except maybe this part - "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house."  I mean, that's just plain un-American, right there.  And that part about stoning your children or selling your daughter into slavery, I think that part's a metaphor.  But gays!  Man, does God hate the gays!  He didn't put them in the top ten, but it's definitely worse than that thing about my neighbor's house.</blockquote>
