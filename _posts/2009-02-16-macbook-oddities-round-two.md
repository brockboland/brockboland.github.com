Remember that <a href="http://www.brockli.com/2009/02/macbook-oddities.php" target="_blank">dot that's been showing up on my MacBook Pro display</a>?  I caught it!  It's definitely not a dead pixel or anything like that, since I was able to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/brockli/3286575690/" target="_blank">screen cap it and zoom in on it</a>.  Still don't know what's going on, though.
