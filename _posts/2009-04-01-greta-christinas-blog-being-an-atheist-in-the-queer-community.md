This one has been sitting in my drafts for a while now.  [Greta Christina wrote a couple months ago](http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2008/12/being-an-atheist-in-the-queer-community.html) about being an atheist in the LGBT community, and gay in the atheist community:

>In a lot of ways, I think the atheist movement today is very much where the queer movement was in the early '70s -- newly visible, newly vocal, pissed off as hell, still finding its voice, just beginning to gain real strength. I think the two communities could learn an enormous amount from each other, and I think that they're natural allies.
>
> And yet, I'm having a realization that I'm finding extremely unsettling.
>
> I've been an out queer, and an active participant in the queer community, for over 20 years now. I've felt for years like the LGBT community was my home base. I've only identified as an atheist for less than two years.
>
> And yet I'm finding that I feel more at home -- more welcomed, more valued, more truly understood -- as a queer in the atheist community than I do as an atheist in the queer community.
>
> Like, a lot more.

Part 2: [How To Be An Ally with Atheists](http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2008/12/how-to-be-an-ally-with-atheists.html).

And a postscript: Greta consistently writes great posts about atheism and other stuff - including sex, so viewer beware.
