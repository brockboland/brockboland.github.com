> Maybe you've read it. 10 Myths -- and 10 Truths -- About Atheism. Sam Harris's famous op-ed piece for the L.A. Times. An attempt to clear up the most common misunderstandings about atheists.

> The piece is a good idea. But something about it bugs me. Specifically, it bugs me how much time Harris spent dissing religion. Don't get me wrong -- I think religion deserves criticism. But here, I think it's inappropriate. If you're writing a piece saying, "Here's who we are, and why the myths about us are incorrect," IMO you shouldn't go off on a "Here's why the rest of you are losers" tangent. It's not persuasive... and it's seriously off-topic.
