I haven't been getting as much exercise as I should, and this evening was quite a bit cooler than most we've had lately.  It was a perfect evening to ride down to [Haines Point](http://www.bikely.com/maps/bike-path/Haines-Point-Washington-DC), a 3.2 mile loop of well-kept, lightly-trafficked pavement that local bikers use to train.  

I got passed a lot while I was there by much more fashionable and trim individuals wearing much flashier outfits, but I still managed two laps.  Between the ride there, the two laps, and then tooling around the city on my way home, I rode just shy of 14.5 miles tonight - a personal record for a single ride!  I know it's not a lot, but cut me some slack - I'm a fat guy and I'm working my way up.

* **Total Distance:** 14.43mi
* **Average Speed:** 12.3 mph
* **Max Speed:** 23.7 mph
* **Total Ride Time:** 1:10

My goal is to ride to work three times a week next summer.  It's about 10 miles from home, but mostly uphill.  The loop at Haines Point is flat and easy-going, except for the headwinds at the southern end, but it's still a good place to work on my endurance.  In the evening, it's almost all bikes, so I think it would be worth it to go do laps as often as I can.

And according to the Internet, I burned over 900 calories on that ride.  That's damn near half my daily intake! (more on that part later)  I'm not gonna lie: I'm feeling pretty good tonight.
