Did another two laps around Haines Point again tonight - the same ride as [Tuesday night](http://www.brockboland.com/2009/08/i-feel-goooood), except I didn't get lost in the middle and came straight home after, so it was shorter.

* **Total Distance:** 11.88 mi
* **Average Speed:** 12 mph
* **Max Speed:** 65.9 mph (might be a fluke with my cyclometer, but I doubt it)
* **Total Ride Time:** 58 minutes
* **Calories Burned:** about 600

Not bad.  And it may be TMI, but I can pedal a lot longer than I can sit on a bike saddle.  I've got low-end padded bike shorts, and I'm wondering if it would be worth investing in a better pair to make the ride more comfortable.
