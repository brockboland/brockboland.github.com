I got drizzled on for the last of my three laps around Haines Point this morning, but hey - I'm up to three laps.

* **Total Distance:** 14.64 mi
* **Average Speed:** 13.5 mph
* **Max Speed:** 26.6 mph, cruising along Independence Ave
* **Total Ride Time:** 1:05
* **Calories Burned:** about 900

It occurred to me when I got home that I should really be more careful when I'm out riding these days.  Not because I'm usually reckless or anything like that, but because I'll look pretty stupid at my wedding in three weeks if I'm in a cast and stitches.
