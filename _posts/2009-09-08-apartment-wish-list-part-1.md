As much as I love our current apartment, things could always be a *little* bit better in some way, no matter where you are.  I'm calling this Part 1 because I'm sure I'll think of more, but for now, I'd love me some:

**Street-level bike parking**

Our building has a bike rack in the parking garage below the building.  It's indoor behind a locked door, so it's better than outside, but it still didn't keep Erin's last bike from being stolen.  The real problem is the day-to-day practicality of it - we don't have a clicker for the garage door, and it's a pain in the neck to go down to the garage to walk a bike through three sets of doors and an elevator to get outside.  Actually, even parking them in our apartment would be better, if we had room for them.

Ahh, someday.
