Ya know what?  I think that if our apartment were lower than it is (the 13th floor), I might not need [street-level parking](http://www.brockboland.com/2009/09/apartment-wish-list-part-1).

We have a small balcony - too small to really use, even, since it's not even big enough for a chair.  But, what if we installed some kind of swing arm just below the ceiling, rigged that up to a motor, and attached a bike lift with an electric winch?  How cool would it be to stand outside and use a remote to swing the bike out over the side of the balcony and lower it down?

If I ever own an apartment with a balcony lower than, say, the fourth floor, I might try to get away with this.
