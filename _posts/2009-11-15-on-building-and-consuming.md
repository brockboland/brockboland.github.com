Merlin Mann, in <a href='http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/243861520/marco'>Three things about Marco Arment</a> (emphasis mine):
<blockquote><p><strong>We all need to figure out what the fuck it is that we can do to make this gig better for everybody.</strong> Yes, starting with ourselves and the ones closest to us. But, I’m more convinced than ever that the path to feeling whole and happy means bucking up, dropping the “poor me” act, and stopping everything you need to until you figure out the next thing you can do that would make you feel alive and useful — driven by something other than the need to rationalize why you aren’t where you want to be.</p>
<p>Doesn’t have to be a cool computer program or a rocket to the moon. <strong>But, it’s worth remembering that we all have at least a little potential to do something bigger and more useful than pissing ourselves about what we don’t have or what we can’t do.</strong></p></blockquote>

And part of <a href='http://www.marco.org/244246945'>Marco's response</a>:
<blockquote><p>There’s only so much time in the day, and only so many days in our lives. There’s enough great work out there that you don’t need to waste any time with anything that isn’t great...</p>

<p>Life’s too short to drink bad coffee or read bad blogs.</p>

<p>Make the effort to care.</p></blockquote>
