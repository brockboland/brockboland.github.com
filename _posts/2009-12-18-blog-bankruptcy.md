Not unlike [last time](http://www.brockboland.com/2008/09/reboot.php), I've been putting off posting because there are more important things I haven't had a chance to write about. So, I'm declaring blog bankruptcy yet again, with the understanding that I feel bad that I haven't written about:

* Our awesome wedding
* Our awesome honeymoon
* Turning 26
* Being in DC for four full years
* Leaving the job I've had for those four years
* Starting a new job
* Paying off my credit cards (thanks entirely to Erin)
* Various other more minor things

I still intend to write about that stuff soon-ish, but I'm not going to feel bad about posting about other, smaller stuff in the meantime.
