For the moment, yes: Garland.

I finally made some time to migrate my blog from WordPress to Drupal. The content is all moved over and the old paths are still intact, and one of these days I'll find or build a new theme. But for now, yes, I'm using the default Drupal theme, which is the web developer equivalent of wearing a fanny pack to the opening night of a cool new bar.

Furthermore, some other changes are on the way. I don't know why it took me so long to realize this, but friends coming here to see what I've been up to don't want to hear about web development stuff, and people coming to read about web development don't want to see the atheist stuff. All religion-related content will soon be moved off into a new site that my lovely wife Erin and I are launching in a few weeks, and I may splinter other topics off into their own sites. The reader base here is and always has been pretty small (hi, guys!), so I've never felt too bad about tossing everything in together because I never had much of an audience. Still, I would like to separate things out for myself a bit, and at least put some separation to my professional life (the web development stuff) and my personal life (the atheism/biking/DC stuff).

I'll announce the new site here when it launches - stay tuned.
