I spent the second half of this past week at the Hotel Palomar for the advanced portion of the [Lullabot Drupal Module Development Deep Dive Week](http://www.lullabot.com/events/workshops/drupal-module-development-deep-dive-week-washington-dc-2010-07-12). I'm still on a little bit of a nerd high: it was an interesting, invigorating, and exciting three days that left me wanting to jump right into the issue queue and start fixing stuff, testing patches, and writing modules. I can only imagine how I'd feel after a full Drupalcon. I wish I could also go to the [theming deep dive week in Portland](http://www.lullabot.com/events/workshops/drupal-theming-portland-or-2010), and I would definitely recommend it to any Drupal developer who can make it: the Lullabots are great.

Since I started coming down with the plague sometime Thursday, I haven't done much but lay around and drink tea since leaving the hotel last night. I still need to organize all my notes and review the presentations, and then there's a long list of links to articles and modules I want to review. Over the three days I was there, we covered:

* Views integration
* AHAH in Forms API
* CCK integration
* Securing your code
* Using alter hooks
* Defining your own hooks
* Keeping content/configuration ("contentfiguration" in [Eaton](http://www.lullabot.com/about/team/jeff-eaton)-speak) in code (and thus, in source control)
* Using Drush
* Features module
* Writing tests with Simpletest
* Changes in Drupal 7
* How to contribue code

A few of these areas really caught my interest, like unit testing and contributing code back. I'm hoping I can make some time to experiment in the coming weeks, and intend to write about it here when I do (I don't have many readers, I know, but I find myself referring back to posts on here all the time when I'm trying to remember how I did something before).
