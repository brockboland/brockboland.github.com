Sometimes I want to update the Drupal core without updating all the modules and themes I have installed. By default, `drush up` will update everything, but that's not what I wanted to do today. This seems like the kind of thing that would be easy to find on Google, but no such luck.

So, for the benefit of the next drush newb:

`drush up drupal`

Makes sense, right?
