Have spammers started employing people to actually read and comment on blogs? I just got a comment on a [two year-old post about Devner](http://www.brockboland.com/2008/04/denver-weird):

> I do agree that Denver is weird, though other parts of Colorado are perfectly beautiful. Also, it is a pity that you didn't go out of your hotel/conference venue for your entire trip to Vegas, there is so much to see and to do! Maybe next time, in fact, no maybe about it - you simply MUST. Trust me man. Tim from leather armchair

Somebody actually took the time to read the post, comment on it with some context, and sign off with a link. I'm a little bit impressed - but not impressed enough to leave the comment there.
