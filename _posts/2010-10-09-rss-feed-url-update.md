<p>If you read this blog in an RSS feed reader, please update the URL for the feed. The new feed is:</p><p>http://feeds.feedburner.com/brockboland</p><p>The old feed will work for a little while longer, but I'm going to kill it off sooner or later, so if you want to continue seeing posts from this blog please update to the new URL.</p><p>This is part of a larger set of changes I'll be announcing in the next day or two. I finally made some time for &nbsp;the <a href="/2010/08/forking-blog">blog-forking</a>&nbsp;project that I mentioned a couple months ago, and have been getting a couple other sites set up for different kinds of content. I'll have two new blogs launching this week, and hopefully one more soon after (once I decide on a name for it), so stay tuned for all of that!</p>
