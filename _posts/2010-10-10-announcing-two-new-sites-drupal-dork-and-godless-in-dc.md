<p>While I don't get a lot of visitors to this blog, I recognize that the people who <strong>do</strong> read it are unlikely to be interested in all the things I am. That's why I <a href="/2010/08/forking-blog">decided a few months ago</a> to split this blog off into a few topic-specific sites, and after a couple of false starts, I sorted out all the issues and got two of the sites launched this weekend</p><p><a href="http://www.drupaldork.com/">Drupal Dork</a> will be about web development, specifically with the <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> CMS. I've been developing with Drupal for nearly a year now and have written about it several times here. Those posts have been mirrored on the new site. One of the upcoming posts will be about the different strategies I tried to get all three of these sites running from a single Drupal install, and why I eventually gave up on it. (Intriguing, right?)</p><p><a href="http://www.godlessindc.com/">Godless In DC</a> is a joint blog with my wife, Erin. We are both atheists with strong opinions on religion, and this site is born out conversations we were having together. I expect this site to be less about specific news items (like events or legislation) and more about our opinions on bigger-picture topics of religion, but we'll see how it plays out.</p><p>I also expect to spin off a biking blog soon. As I've gotten more into biking, I inevitably have found myself with more to say; half of the posts on my front page right now are about it.</p><p>This blog will be the catch-all for anything that doesn't fit into those categories, and will probably only be interesting to people who actually know me - if even them. But hey, thanks for visiting! I take requests!</p><p>Again, here are the links and RSS feeds. I hope you'll subscribe to one or all of them, because I like you THIS much.</p><p><a href="/">Personal blog</a> (this one):&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brockboland">http://feeds.feedburner.com/brockboland</a></p><p><a href="http://www.drupaldork.com/">Drupal Dork</a>:&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/DrupalDork">http://feeds.feedburner.com/DrupalDork</a></p><p><a href="http://www.godlessindc.com/">Godless In DC</a>:&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GodlessInDc">http://feeds.feedburner.com/GodlessInDc</a></p>
