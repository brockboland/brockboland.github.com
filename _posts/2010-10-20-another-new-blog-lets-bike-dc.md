<p>One final new blog announcement: <a href="http://www.letsbikedc.com/">Let's Bike DC</a>, my new biking blog. I migrated over the biking posts from this site, to start with, and any new posts about biking will go there.</p><p>In case you missed <a href="/2010/10/announcing-two-new-sites-drupal-dork-and-godless-dc">the last announcement</a>, I now post at four different sites. The sites and RSS feeds are as follows:</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><a href="/">Personal blog</a>&nbsp;(this one):&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brockboland">http://feeds.feedburner.com/brockboland</a></p><p><a href="http://www.drupaldork.com/">Drupal Dork</a>:&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/DrupalDork">http://feeds.feedburner.com/DrupalDork</a></p><p><a href="http://www.godlessindc.com/">Godless In DC</a>:&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GodlessInDc">http://feeds.feedburner.com/GodlessInDc</a></p><p><a href="http://www.letsbikedc.com/">Let's Bike DC</a>:&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/LetsBikeDc">http://feeds.feedburner.com/LetsBikeDc</a></p><p>I encourage you to keep an eye on the ones that interest you, and subscribe to the RSS feeds if that's your thing. As I noted in that last post, this blog will mostly be personal stuff from here on out, as the three new blogs cover the more particular topics I'm into. This way, you can easily avoid the stuff you're not interested in.</p>
