For some reason, the dog flings more and more kibble out of her bowl every day. She also refuses to eat food off of the ground in our apartment, even though she tries to do just that outside every day on our walks.

So at some point every afternoon, I bend over and toss the scattered kibble back into her bowl. Hearing the noise that means it's time to eat, she rushes over to gobble up the leftovers that I've collected together for her.

This dog, she does not respond well to reason or logic.
