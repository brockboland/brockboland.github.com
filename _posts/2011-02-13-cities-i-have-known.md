I grew up outside of Buffalo, then went to college outside of Rochester. After that, I moved to DC and then visited San Francisco a few times. 

I barely know Buffalo or Rochester. I grew up in the suburbs, I went to school in the suburbs, and I rarely ventured into the city. Even thought I spent four and a half years right outside Rochester during what I consider to have been my formative years, I didn't have a car, so I never figured out where anything was. When I went into the city, I was in the back seat, along for the ride and not paying much attention to where we were going.

I know DC better than any other city. I lived just across the river in Arlington for my first year and a half here, and I've been living close to downtown ever since.

And after spending maybe 20 days in San Francisco, across several trips, I definitely know it better than either Buffalo or Rochester. It's weird to think that only a few trips there resulted in more quality time in a city than the first 22 years of my life did.
