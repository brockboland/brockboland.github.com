I've been listening to <a href="http://5by5.tv/dailyedition/">The Daily Edition</a> on <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a> lately, and the topic of standing desks has come up a few times lately. Last year, it came to light that <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/stand-up-while-you-read-this/">sitting all day is bad for you</a> even if you exercise more to offset it. I had a standing desk for a while at a previous employer, but figured it wasn't really an option now that I work from home. I would love to get a <a href="http://www.geekdesk.com/">GeekDesk</a>, but there's no way I would spend $750 on a desk.

I got talking to some of the nerds in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/5by5">#5by5</a> Friday afternoon about it, and decided to take a crack at it. Lucky for me, I've got an <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S99861340">IKEA EXPEDIT</a>, so the desk attaches to a shelving unit: if I could find a good way to raise up the other side of the desk, I could just attach it to the top shelf instead of the middle one.

So I biked over to AutoZone this afternoon and picked up a $25 pair of jack stands. It may not be pretty, but my DIY standing desk is the perfect height.
