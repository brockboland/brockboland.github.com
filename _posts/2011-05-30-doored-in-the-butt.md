Today, I came closer to being doored than ever before.

I was on my way home from the Red Cross (side not: give blood!). As I snuck between a lane of cars parked at the curb and a line of cars stopped at a red light, the driver of a Honda Element opened their door just as I was passing. I think they must have seen me and stopped at the last second, because it just bumped me in the hip. I yelled a surprised, "Whoah!" but it didn't hit me hard enough to bother stopping, so I'm not sure what the driver's reaction was.

I got lucky this time. Be careful out there!
