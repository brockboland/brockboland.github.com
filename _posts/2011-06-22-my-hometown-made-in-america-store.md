My lovely wife Erin sent me a link this morning to this NPR story about my hometown: <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/06/22/137301881/made-in-america-store-capitalizes-on-patriotism">'Made In America' Store Capitalizes On Patriotism</a>.

Basically, they only sell things that are completely made in America, "right down to the glue in the packaging." A noble effort, but this last line made me facepalm:

<blockquote>Franchisees are already planning to open more Made in America stores, envisioning it as the next Wal-Mart â€” without the foreign goods.</blockquote>

I just - how do you - what the -

Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart precisely BECAUSE nothing is made in America! You can't sell shit cheap if you have to pay livable wages to the people making it! Is this so hard to grasp?!
