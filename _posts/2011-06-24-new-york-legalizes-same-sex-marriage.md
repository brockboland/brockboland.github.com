I'm only slightly embarrassed to admit that I teared up with joy when I heard the news.

I haven't lived in New York state for nearly six years, have no intention to move back, and am quite content in my heterosexual marriage, so it has no real effect me. But I could not be more excited about the progress being made. It can be so frustrating to watch these political battles play out and wonder how anyone can still oppose gay rights - it's just so goddamn nice to have a victory to be happy about this week.
