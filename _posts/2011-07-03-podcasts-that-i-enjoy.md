It's been a looong time since I've posted about podcasts I listen to - [just over three years](http://www.brockboland.com/2008/04/podcasts-i). A couple of my old favorites are now defunct, and I lost interest in most of the rest of them. I've found plenty of new ones to follow, though:

## From [Maximum Fun](http://maximumfun.org/):
I was first exposed to Maximum Fun way back before it was Maximum Fun. [The Sound of Young America](http://maximumfun.org/shows/sound-young-america) was one of the few podcasts that seemed interesting back when I got my first iPod in 2004, and I remember listening to Jesse's nickname - "America's Radio Sweetheart" - and thinking, "What a smug jackass." I've since come to love that jackass, even though I don't listen to SOYA anymore.

### [Jordan, Jesse, Go!](http://maximumfun.org/shows/jordan-jesse-go)
Jordan and Jesse have a variety of guests on the show, and it's consistently one of the funniest podcasts I listen to. They don't have any particular topic, agenda, or outline, but it's always entertaining.

### [Stop Podcasting Yourself](http://maximumfun.org/shows/stop-podcasting-yourself)
Another hilarious show, hosted by comedians Graham Clark and Dave Shumka. They have a guest most weeks and some regular segments: overheards, drunk dials, etc. [Last week's episode][pftspy], with [Paul F. Tompkins](http://paulftompkins.com/), is a fantastic one to start with - it's hilarious, and even takes a moment to explain what a bumper is so you don't need to go back to ep 1 to find out.

### [My Brother, My Brother, And Me](http://maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me)
An advice show for the modern era hosted by real-life brothers Travis, Justin, and Griffin. They take requests for advice from listeners and from Yahoo Answers. The questions from Yahoo Answers tend to be about the quality you would expect them to be.

### [Judge John Hodgman](http://maximumfun.org/shows/judge-john-hodgman)
Famous Minor Television Personality John Hodgman rules on disputes brought by listeners, with assistance from Bailiff Jesse Thorn.

## From [5by5](http://5by5.tv/):
Founded (and mostly hosted) by [Dan Benjamin](http://hivelogic.com/), the 5by5 network has an impressive [list of shows](http://5by5.tv/broadcasts). I first heard of it when [Merlin Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com/) joined Dan to start Back to Work.

### [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w)
I've always been a fan of everything Merlin has done, and all of it swirls together into this weekly conversation with Dan. The topic, more or less, is doing the kind of work you want to be doing, but it often veers wildly depending on what they feel like talking about. There are also frequent callbacks to jokes or bits from [You Look Nice Today](http://youlooknicetoday.com/) and other projects Merlin has done, so I'm not sure it would appeal to most people as much as it does to idiot fanboys like myself.

### [After Dark](http://5by5.tv/afterdark)
After hosts sign off on 5by5 shows, they typically leave the recorder running and post the after-podcast-conversation to this secret, unlisted feed. I only listen to the ones that come after Back to Work, where Dan and Merlin tend to do a quick wrapup and discuss things they normally wouldn't on the show.

### [Daily Edition](http://5by5.tv/dailyedition)
The Daily Edition was an afternoon podcast that Dan hosted with [Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/), creator of the default Bartik theme in Drupal 7. It's been on hiatus ever since Dan moved last month and I'm not sure if or when it will come back, but I hope it does. It's the one show I listen to live, just like people used to do with actual radios.
