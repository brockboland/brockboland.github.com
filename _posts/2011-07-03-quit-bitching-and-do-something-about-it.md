Everybody complains.  It's human nature.  There's always something to be discontented about, no matter who you are.  Whether it's taxes, politicians, work, the remnants of your 401(k) - everybody's got something to bitch about.  And until recently, my response has usually been, "Well, what ya gonna do?"  My view was that life is too short, so get over it and get on with your life.

Lately, when I hear someone bitching about something, my first thought is, "Seriously, what are you going to do about it?"  We can't change everything that irritates us, but that's no reason to stop trying to fix anything we can.  

So seriously, what are you going to do about it?  What needs to happen in order to make things the way you want them?  Unhappy with the way your country, your state, your neighborhood is being run?  Then run for local office, and start fixing things in your own area.  Unhappy with the way your company is being managed?  Start vying for management positions, or figure out ways to improve the situation and lay them out for the people who can make the change.  Unhappy with your job altogether?  You shouldn't even have time to bitch, between touching up your resume, scouring the job sites, and contacting recruiters.  Unhappy with society?  Find a non-profit that deals with your topic of choice, or start your own.

Quit your bitching, and do something about it.
