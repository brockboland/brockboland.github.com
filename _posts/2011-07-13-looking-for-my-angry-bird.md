<blockquote>You get this idea in your head that this is all bits and bytes. So now, you've got the same idea about this that every bad client has, which is, because it's computer stuff, it's easy and anybody can do it. "Oh, it's computer stuff! All I've got to do is go get a copy of Xcode 4.2, I'm good to go!" Right? "I'll just go slap this together, put it in the store, and I'll retire on my angry bird!"</blockquote>
