<blockquote>
<p>Well. This is where things get a bit tricky to understand. Because most examples of social privilege aren’t that straightforward. Let’s take, for example, a basic bit of male privilege:</p>

<p>A man has the privilege of walking past a group of strange women without worrying about being catcalled, or leered at, or having sexual suggestions tossed at him.</p>

<p>A pretty common male response to this point is “that’s a privilege? I would love if a group of women did that to me.”</p>

<p>And that response, right there, is a perfect shining example of male privilege.</p>

<p>To explain how and why, I am going to throw a lengthy metaphor at you. In fact, it may even qualify as parable. Bear with me, because if it makes everything crystal clear, it will be worth the time.</p>
