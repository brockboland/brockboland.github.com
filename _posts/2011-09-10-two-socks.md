I've learned two things in the two weeks since I purchased two pairs of <a href="http://www.smartwool.com/">SmartWool</a> socks:

a) I never knew socks could be this comfortable, and
b) I never knew I could have such a strong opinion about socks, one way or the other.

I'm never buying cotton socks ever again.
