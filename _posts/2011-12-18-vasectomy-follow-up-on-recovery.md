I realized the other day that I never wrote a follow-up to [the post about getting a vasectomy](http://www.brockboland.com/2011/04/vasecto-me-vasecto-you-vasecto-everybody-room). That one was written hours after the procedure, and I intended to follow-up on it soon after, but forgot to.

As with the last one, if you don't want to hear about this kind of thing, stop reading now.

The recovery was not as smooth as I'd hoped it would be. There weren't any complications or anything, but it took longer than I had expected. I bruised up pretty bad in the week after the procedure, and remained achey for another week or two after that. The doctor had prescribed pain medication, but it made me feel spacey and I couldn't concentrate, so I didn't bother taking them after the third or fourth day. For the next two months, I would occasionally experience some aching pain, like things had got situated wrong or something.

So that kind of sucked, but it was never bad enough to have me really worried. I didn't get around to doing a follow-up appointment until three months after the procedure, and the doctor said that the incisions had healed up fine, but experiencing some discomfort that far out wasn't cause for alarm. By that time, it was just an occasional thing, and was really just uncomfortable.

It was probably a solid four months after the procedure when I completely stopped aching. And I know it sounds like a four month recovery for a vasectomy is insane, but the reality is that it was two weeks of achiness, and then occasional mild discomfort once or twice a week after thatâ€”definitely not bad enough to make me regret anything.

All things considered, I'm really, really glad I did it. The peace of mind was worth a couple months of sitting down gingerly.
