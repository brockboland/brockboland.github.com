You probably caught last week's PR fiasco courtesy of AllThis, but if not, Internet buddy Joel Housman <a href="http://joelhousman.com/2011/12/19/this-week-in-douchebaggery-allthis-com/">has a great post covering the goings-on</a>. This week, the makers of a video game controller put themselves in the crosshair—or really, put <em>himself</em> in the crosshair, since it seems to involve a single guy.

From <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/resources/just-wow1.html">Just Wow!</a> on Penny Arcade:

<blockquote>I got an incredible email today from a Penny Arcade reader. Dave shared with me an email chain between him and Ocean Marketing (the folks behind the Avenger controller) Trust me when I tell you that this is one wild ride. I’m serious, Mr. Toad would look at this ride and just give a slow clap while shaking his head. </blockquote>

The email thread in that post demonstrates an impressive lack of savvy, and it's no surprise that responding the way he did brought down the nerd rage hammer. Mike <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/resources/an-update1.html">posted a follow-up later in the day</a>, including the guy's apology letter. He ended with this fantastic analysis of the situation:

<blockquote>I think there is a big difference between being sorry and being sorry you got caught. I have a real problem with bullies. I spent my childhood moving from school to school and I got made fun of everyplace I landed. I feel like Paul is a bully and maybe that’s why I have no sympathy here. Someday every bully meets and even bigger bully and maybe that’s me in this case.  It’s the same thing that happened with Jack Thompson. It might not always make the most business sense and it is a policy that has caused us some legal problems, but I really don’t give a shit about that. When these assholes threaten me or Penny Arcade I just laugh. I will personally burn everything I’ve made to the fucking ground if I think I can catch them in the flames.</blockquote>

Some may see it as childish, but that's standing up for something.
