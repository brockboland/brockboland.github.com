From <a href="http://signature.microsoft.com/default.aspx">Microsoft Signature</a>:
<blockquote>Many new PCs come filled with lots of trialware and sample software that slows your computer downâ€”removing all that is a pain, so we do it for you! Every PC the Microsoft Store sells is put on a software diet and performance is tuned to run the best it can. 

We call this process Microsoft Signature.</blockquote>

Just so we're clear: it's now considered a "feature" to buy a computer that doesn't come with a bunch of shit that should not have been there in the first place.
