From <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/01/09/theBossesDoEverythingBette.html">Scripting News: The bosses do everything better</a>:

<blockquote>I said give him the code.

The way I figured it, either he pulled it off or he didn't. If he did, at least we'd know what he was asking for. Because when he sat down to implement it he'd have to answer the questions he didn't want to answer verbally. If he failed, maybe we could have the conversation we needed to have. Or maybe he would appreciate how hard the work was. Or whatever.</blockquote>

Thankful I haven't had a boss like this.
