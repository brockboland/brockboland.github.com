From <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-things-rich-people-need-to-stop-saying/">6 Things Rich People Need to Stop Saying | Cracked.com</a>:

<blockquote>So when I say "We're all in this together," I'm not stating a philosophy. I'm stating a fact about the way human life works. No, you never asked for anything to be handed to you. You didn't have to, because billions of humans who lived and died before you had already created a lavish support system where the streets are all but paved with gold. Everyone reading this -- all of us living in a society advanced enough to have Internet access -- was born one inch away from the finish line, plopped here at birth, by other people.</blockquote>

I don't usually read Cracked.com, but this article is pretty great.
