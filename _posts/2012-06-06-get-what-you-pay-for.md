If you don't offer good pay for developers, you won't get the best and brightest: you get those who couldn't get hired by companies that pay better, and the passionate who would work with you regardless. 

If you see that your developers are not as good as you want them to be and think that the solution is to lower their pay, you'll just push away the most capable ones who CAN get better pay elsewhere.

So, why would this be any different for teachers?
