<blockquote>Back before knives, everyone would get served a whole chicken for dinner. It was too much food, and much of it ended up going to waste. Finally, someone said, "What if we invented something to turn the whole chicken into pieces of chicken?" And thus, the first knife was born.</blockquote>
