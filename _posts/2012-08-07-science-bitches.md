I'm going to be honest: I didn't bother reading the CNN article, because this was the only part I needed from <a href="http://www.itsokaytobesmart.com/post/28938334277/cnn-mars-coverage-go-jump-off-a-bridge">It's Okay To Be Smart • I was gonna let this slide</a>:
<blockquote>We live in a time when our citizens’ acceptance of science balances on a razor thin edge between the Age of the Future and the Dark Ages. Finding people who don’t accept science is nothing new, but we live in an era where our very ability to survive and flourish as a civilization is dependent on science. Not “kinda-sorta dependent” but “everything that we interact with is built on the products of science”. Climate effects, technology, future employment, dealing with population growth … it’s all going to require people to at least trust in and be comfortable with science.</blockquote>

SO MANY TIMES THIS.

For example: **you don't get to not believe in global warming**. It doesn't matter what you believe, not in the slightest. Most climate scientists—like, all but a handful—are in complete agreement that humans are causing the environment to change more quickly than it would otherwise. You can argue that the average temperature of the globe has always fluctuated, but you know what? People smarter than you have spent a hell of a lot more time studying it than any anchor on Fox News, and they say there's more to it. Until we as a society—all of us in this society—accept that we don't know as much as the specialists, we're going to keep wasting countless hours to arguments that do nothing to improve us as a species.

So stop being an asshole and recognize that some people know more than you about some stuff, cool?
