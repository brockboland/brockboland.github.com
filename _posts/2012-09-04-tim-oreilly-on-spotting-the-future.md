Tim O’Reilly, from <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2012/04/ff_spotfuture_qas/all/">8 Visionaries on How They Spot the Future</a>:

<blockquote>The myth of innovation is that it starts with entrepreneurs, but it really starts with people having fun. The Wright brothers weren’t trying to build an airline, they were saying, "Holy shit, do you think we could fly?" The first kids who made snowboards, they just glued skis together and said, "Let’s try this!" With the web, none of us thought there was money in it. People said, "This document came from halfway around the world. How awesome is that!"</blockquote>
