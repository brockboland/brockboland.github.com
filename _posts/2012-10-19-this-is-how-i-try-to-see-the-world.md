From <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/06/mf_icons_diamandis/3/">X Prize Founder Peter Diamandis Has His Eyes on the Future | Wired Science | Wired.com</a>:

<blockquote><strong>Greenwald: How do you maintain your optimism amid the deadening barrage of bad news from around the globe?</strong>

Diamandis: Our brains are wired to look for negative information. The amygdala is the danger center. Our senses are routed through it before they get to the cortex. When we heard a rustle in the branches, we thought tiger, not wind. That’s why, in the news, if it bleeds it leads. But the facts are absolutely clear. The world is getting better at an extraordinary rate. The technologies available for solving problems are becoming more powerful and empowering more people. Will there be problems? Disasters? Pandemics? Terrorist attacks? Of course. But humanity picks up and keeps moving. In this country, lifespans nearly doubled in the last century. Per capita income more than tripled, and the cost of food, energy, transportation, and communications have dropped exponentially. That’s my source of optimism. That and a realization I made early on that if there’s a problem, I’m going to solve it. Once you see the world that way, it’s a different place.</blockquote>
