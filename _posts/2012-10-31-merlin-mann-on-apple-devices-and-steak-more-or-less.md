Merlin Mann, in <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/91">Back to Work episode 91</a>:

<blockquote>Try and talk somebody out of the stuff that they enjoy in life, is like trying to talk them out of their faith or their sexuality. Like, it's a pointless exercise that can never be anything but acrimonious, and will only highlight unnecessary amounts of difference about things that ultimately don't really matter. Buy the steak you like. Worship the god you love. Neck with the people that you treasure. And don't worry about the numbers.

That's what this is about. I am not going to have to sit there and look at sixteen Android devices to know whether it's worth it to spend a hundred dollars less to buy this."Oh my god! Three hundred and twenty nine dollars?! Where's my blog?"

â€¦

I'm not an expert about this stuff, by any stretch of the imagination, but I am old enough and mature enough to understand that certain people enjoy certain things, certain people will pay for certain things, and if you don't enjoy it and can't pay for it, then why is it even an issue? You can't just be mad at the guy who runs the steakhouse because he's figured out how to charge for a chateaubriand that you don't want.</blockquote>

They were comparing the "Apple tax" to eating at an expensive steakhouse, and while it kind of came of like he was to likening competing devices to cheap burgers, I like the bigger picture of it: who cares if people want to spend a little more for something they'll enjoy? What's the use in arguing about it?
