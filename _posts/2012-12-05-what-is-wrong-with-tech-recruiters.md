And my fairly-standard response:

And just to be clear, I'm not trying to be personal here: I respond to messages like this just about every day, and most of the developers I know do as well. We know when you guys just match a few keywords and fire off the boilerplate "your background looks perfect!" or "I heard about your skills from a former colleague!" Take two minutes to actually read a profile before you reach out to someone: it'll go a long way.

I used to send polite replies indicating that I wasn't interested, but these have become so common and so regular that I've surely made a number of enemies among recruiters in the DC area…which is a net positive, as far as I'm concerned.

My profile literally begins with "Recruiters: I am not interested in a new position, nor am I available for freelance work at this time. I don't know how I can make this clearer; I'm just reporting you guys as spam at this point." The Contact Me section gets even less notice:

> I am not available for freelance work, nor am I interested in new full-time employment.
> 
> RECRUITERS: Please don't try to connect with me about full time positions. I am perfectly content where I'm working right now. If you send me an invite without at least acknowledging this paragraph, I'll know that you didn't even bother to check if I wanted to be contacted, and I will make sure that I never work with you in the future. Also, I'm marking you as spam.
