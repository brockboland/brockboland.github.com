From [Racism Doesnâ€™t Exist in Tech Because White Tech Blog Millionaire Jason Calacanis Has Never Seen It](http://gawker.com/5981825/racism-doesnt-exist-in-tech-because-white-tech-blog-millionaire-jason-calacanis-has-never-seen-it):

> Calacanis and his ilk have no interest in examining the systemic effects and implicit biases that, in aggregate, result in white, male mastheads and employee lists because it might lead them to understand that their success was determined not by their talent and drive only but also by the institutional advantages of their whiteness and maleness.

Bingo.

Reminds me of a political cartoon that I can't seem to find now. Describing it won't do it justice, but it was a series of panels showing white guys getting an edge over black guys over the course of time: a white guy being accepted to college while the black guy is told the class is full, or a black guy being told that the job advertised by a "Now Hiring" sign was just filled (by the white guy in the background), ending with a present-day white guy saying something like "But **I** don't benefit from being white!" I really hope I can find it, because it perfectly illustrates a concept to which people like Calacanis seem to be blind.
