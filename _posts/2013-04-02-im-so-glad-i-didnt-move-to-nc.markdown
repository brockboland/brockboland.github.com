[From WRAL.com](http://www.wral.com/proposal-would-allow-state-religion-in-north-carolina/12296876/):

> A bill filed by Republican lawmakers would allow North Carolina to declare an official religion, in violation of the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Bill of Rights, and seeks to nullify any federal ruling against Christian prayer by public bodies statewide.
>
> The bill grew out of a federal lawsuit filed last month by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Rowan County Board of Commissioners. In the lawsuit, the ACLU says the board has opened 97 percent of its meetings since 2007 with explicitly Christian prayers.

I'm really curious about the overlap of "People who think it's OK for North Carolina to establish a state religion in violation of the Constitution," and, "People who think that state-level gun control is a violation of the Constitution."
