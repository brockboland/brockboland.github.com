This delights me for two reasons.

1. This pope is way more Jesusy than the last pope. I love that he's brought some humility back to a post more recently known for elaborate thrones and fancy shoes.
2. Catholics questioning the authority of the pope. I have long held that it would do everyone some good to take a long hard look at what the believe and why, and decide whether their beliefs really jive with what's handed down from on high by the Church. Granted, the reason for their introspection now seems to be outrage that the pope had the audacity to wash lady feet and treat non-believers and gays with some measure of dignity, but still.
