From [First World Problems](http://mattgemmell.com/first-world-problems/):

> The dismissed person feels judged, but the *dismissive* one also needs to take a long, hard look at themselves. It’s a dangerous thing to appoint yourself as the judge of another person’s problems, and whether they really ‘count’ or not.
>
> That’s the kind of thinking that caused mental health care to be marginalised for so many decades: the idea that *it could be a lot worse*, so by extension you should just pull yourself together and get on with it. It’s a systemic failure of empathy.
>
> Now, that’s taking it to extremes, most definitely. There’s a gulf of experience between mental health problems and forgetting your iPhone charger. But it’s such a corrosive attitude to casually disregard and disdain whatever someone else is complaining about. There’s a thread of sociopathy to it.
