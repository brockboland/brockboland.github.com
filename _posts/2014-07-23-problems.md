Daniel Jalkut, on [Core Intuition episode 146](http://www.coreint.org/2014/07/episode-146-a-swift-bias/):

> I don't have to solve the problems in order to observe…a problem. And it doesn't necessarily mean, when you observe a problem, that you condemn all of the causes of the problem.

The conversation was about [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), but he was making the point in a broader context, and it's. It bugs me to no end when people take the "Well, you don't have any better ideas" position in an argument. I see this the most in political debates on Facebook, as if one can't comment on a problem in, say, immigration policy unless one has a fully-formed solution to said problem—a problem, mind you, that is inherently complex, or else there wouldn't be any debate about how to address it.

I've also been guilty of taking this position myself in the past: it's one to be careful about.
