I'm very excited to announce that in a few weeks, I'll be joining [Vokal Interactive](http://vokalinteractive.com/) as an iOS Engineer!

This is a big move for me. I've wanted to develop for the iPhone since it was introduced in 2007, but never seemed to have the time to learn the language and framework until early last year. After a lot of nights and weekends, and some work-week time generously provided by Lullabot, I've got [Shoot](http://shoot.sh/) in the App Store, and I'm ready to take on some more challenging apps.

The downside, of course, is that I must leave [Lullabot](http://www.lullabot.com/) in order to pursue mobile development full-time. I love the folks at Lullabot and have really enjoyed my time here, but it's time for me to make the switch from web to mobile. And by the way, if you're looking for a great company to work with, [Lullabot is hiring](https://www.lullabot.com/jobs)!
