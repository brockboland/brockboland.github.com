I've never liked reading interviews, so I appreciate it when other people pick out the good parts, as [Kottke did](http://kottke.org/14/12/interview-with-chris-rock) with [this Chris Rock interview](http://www.vulture.com/2014/11/chris-rock-frank-rich-in-conversation.html):

> Q: It's about white people adjusting to a new reality?
>
> A: Owning their actions. Not even their actions. The actions of your dad. Yeah, it's unfair that you can get judged by something you didn't do, but it's also unfair that you can inherit money that you didn't work for.
