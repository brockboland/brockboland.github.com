I’m skimming through my calendar for the past 12 months, looking for bigger goings-on that I might have forgotten about in preparation for writing a “farewell 2014” blog post, and man: I cannot believe how long ago some stuff happened. Some of these events trigger some other memory, so I search my daily logs for it and find out, oh holy crap, it was over four years ago when I had a drink with Erik from BicycleSPACE and we wound up chatting with a guy who was in town for some kind of A/V conference and he and Erik connected because Erik wanted to get some projectors or something.

Time keeps going faster. I’ve observed it myself, and others have warned me that it only gets worse, but that doesn’t make it easier to swallow.
