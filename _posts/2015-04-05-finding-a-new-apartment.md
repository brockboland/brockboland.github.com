I've mentioned before that I've moved quite a bit, and a while back I [wrote up some guidlines to moving efficiently](/2013/08/moving-efficiently/)—guidelines that I've since consulted myself, twice. And before you can move, of course, you need to find a place to move to. Like that post, I expect to continue updating this one with tips as I think of them.

- **Location, location, location.** It's a cliche for a reason, and matters more for people like me who want to live without a car. Where's the closest public transit? How about a grocery store and pharmacy? Can you get to work easily? Speaking of which:
- **Commute times matter. A lot.** This is not news: it's easy to find articles about studies showing that longer commute times make us miserable. One such article stuck with me when the writer pointed out how people think that a larger home will make them happier—so much space for activities!—but the increased commute necessary to get out to the suburbs (where such a home is affordable) fully negates any benefit of extra space. Your mileage will vary, of course, but I've embraced the short commute over extra space.
- **The inside of the apartment doesn't matter much.** I don't know how many times I've seen an empty apartment and been underwhelmed, but moved in anyway because it was the best option available. Know what? A few weeks later, it really didn't matter. Once your stuff is there, and the place scrubbed down (if necessary), and you're settled in and used to the noises it makes, it doesn't really matter that much: the layout, the fixtures, the counter top, the closets—they'll become the new normal in no time.
- **Check the water pressure.** OK, *most* of the inside of an apartment doesn't matter, but taking a weak-ass shower every morning is no way to be your best self.
- **Square footage is a ballpark**. I've seen "500 square foot" apartments that were considerably smaller than "700 square foot" apartments. Apartment listings here in Chicago don't often include the measurement anyway, but always take them with a grain of salt. As much as the inside of the apartment doesn't matter (see above), you want to make sure it's going to be big enough for your stuff, and potentially your pet and/or partner.
- **Visit the neighborhood at night.** Typically, apartment-seekers see the place during the day, but that doesn't necessarily tell you what it's like to live there. If you saw Adams Morgan (DC) or Wrigleyville (Chicago) at 4 on a Wednesday, you might think it's a quiet little neighborhood with lots of restaurants. Unless you're just moving to one of those cities, you would know those two examples, but make sure you know if your potential new neighborhood is swarmed with drunken college kids every weekend.
- **Consider foot traffic flow.** Is there a bar next door? Or maybe right around the corner? Does one have pass your place to get from the barto the train station? Then you might have a bunch of drunks wandering past your place late at night, with the singing and/or fighting that sometimes comes with it. I lucked out at a place in DC: we were right around the corner from a strip of bars, but on a sidestreet that only went one block, uphill, before T-boning the next street over. There was no reason for anyone to leave a bar and walk down our block, because it didn't go anywhere: we were close to all the fun without the side effects.
- **Make sure you know what's outside the windows.** I keep my blinds shut almost all the time, because I don't like the idea of people outside looking at me. If this is a concern for you, it might be good to know that the living room is right next to the front entry to the building, or facing directly into someone else's living room across a narrow courtyard. Or, if you're concerned about security, it would be good to know if the back window is at ground-level in a dark alley. You might also want to notice if a second-floor apartment has a street light right by the bedroom window.
