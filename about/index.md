My name is Brock. Here's the stuff I like:

* My wife. She's pretty rad.
* Our dog, Lola May. She's pretty cute.
* Programming. I spent about nine years in web development before switching to the mobile world.
* That's it. I don't like other stuff.

I do stuff elsewhere sometimes too:

* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/brock)
* [Github](http://github.com/brockboland)
* <a href="https://plus.google.com/101596666868636644708" rel="me">Google+</a> (I don't use this much)
